  Short description Genetically engineered T cell  
In   biology  , '''chimeric antigen receptors'''  '''CARs'''  also known as '''chimeric immunoreceptors''', '''chimeric T cell receptors''' or '''artificial T cell receptors''' are                           receptor   proteins that have been engineered to give   T cell  s the new ability to target a specific   antigen  . The receptors are                  chimeric   in that they combine both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions into a single receptor.

CAR T   cell therapy   uses T cells engineered with CARs to treat cancer. T cells are modified to recognize cancer cells and destroy them. The standard approach is to harvest T cells from patients, genetically alter them, then infuse the resulting CAR T cells into patients to attack their tumors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

CAR T cells can be derived either   autologous  ly from T cells in a patient's own blood or                       allogeneically   from those of a donor. Once isolated, these T cells are genetically engineered to express a specific CAR, using a vector derived from an engineered lentivirus such as HIV  see   Lentiviral vector in gene therapy   . The CAR programs the T cells to target an antigen present on the tumor cell surface. For safety, CAR T cells are engineered to be specific to an antigen that is expressed on a tumor cell but not on healthy cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

After the modified T cells are infused into a patient, they act as a  living drug  against cancer cells.                           When they come in contact with their targeted antigen on a cell's surface, T cells bind to it and become activated, then proceed to proliferate and become   cytotoxic  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      CAR T cells destroy cells through several mechanisms, including extensive stimulated cell proliferation, increasing the degree to which they are toxic to other living cells  cytotoxicity , and by causing the increased secretion of factors that can affect other cells such as   cytokine  s,   interleukin  s and growth factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

The surface of CAR T cells can bear either of two types of   co-receptors  ,   CD4   and   CD8  . These two cell types, called CD4  and CD8 , respectively, have different and interacting cytotoxic effects. Therapies employing a 1-to-1 ratio of the cell types apparently provide           synergistic   antitumor effects.

   History   
The first chimeric receptors containing portions of an   antibody   and the   T cell receptor   was described in 1987 by Yoshihisa Kuwana et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             at Fujita Health University and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, Co. Ltd. in Japan, and independently in 1989 by   Gideon Gross   and   Zelig Eshhar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      at the   Weizmann Institute   in Israel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Originally termed  T-bodies , these early approaches combined an antibody's ability to specifically bind to           diverse targets   with the constant domains of the                   TCR-α   or                   TCR-β   proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

In 1991,                  chimeric receptors   containing the intracellular signaling domain of         CD3ζ   were shown to activate T cell signaling by                            Arthur Weiss   at the   University of California, San Francisco  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This work prompted CD3ζ intracellular domains to be added to chimeric receptors with antibody-like extracellular domains, commonly                                  single-chain fraction variable    scFv  domains, as well as proteins such as   CD4  , subsequently termed first generation CARs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

A first generation CAR containing a CD4 extracellular domain and a CD3ζ intracellular domain was used in the first clinical trial of chimeric antigen receptor T cells by the biotechnology company   Cell Genesys   in the mid 1990s, allowing adoptively transferred T cells to target   HIV   infected cells, although it failed to show any clinical improvement.                  Similar early clinical trials of CAR T cells in solid tumors in the 1990s using first generation CARs targeting a solid tumor antigens such as   MUC1   did not show long-term persistence of the transferred T cells or result in significant remissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

In the early 2000s, co-stimulatory domains such as   CD28   or         4-1BB   were added to first generation CAR's CD3ζ intracellular domain. Termed second generation CARs, these constructs showed greater persistence and improved tumor clearance in pre-clinical models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Clinical trials in the early 2010s using second generation CARs targeting   CD19  , a protein expressed by normal   B cell  s as well as   B-cell leukemia  s and                   lymphomas  , by investigators at the                             NCI  ,   University of Pennsylvania  , and   Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center   demonstrated the clinical efficacy of CAR T cell therapies and resulted in complete remissions in many heavily pre-treated patients.                  These trials ultimately led in the                            US   to the                                FDA  's first two approvals of CAR T cells in 2017, those for   tisagenlecleucel    Kymriah , marketed by   Novartis   originally for B-cell precursor   acute lymphoblastic leukemia    B-ALL , and   axicabtagene ciloleucel    Yescarta , marketed by   Kite Pharma   originally for   diffuse large B-cell lymphoma    DLBCL .                  There are now six FDA-approved CAR T therapies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

   Production   
  File:CAR-Engineered T-Cell Adoptive Transfer.jpg thumb Depiction of adoptive cell transfer therapy with CAR-engineered T cells  

The first step in the production of CAR T-cells is the isolation of T cells from human blood. CAR T-cells may be manufactured either from the patient's own blood, known as an                       autologous   treatment, or from the blood of a healthy donor, known as an                       allogeneic   treatment. The manufacturing process is the same in both cases; only the choice of initial blood donor is different.                                   

First,   leukocyte  s are isolated using a blood cell separator in a process known as   leukocyte apheresis  .   Peripheral blood mononuclear cell  s  PBMCs  are then separated and collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The products of leukocyte apheresis are then transferred to a cell-processing center. In the cell processing center, specific T cells are stimulated so that they will actively proliferate and expand to large numbers. To drive their expansion, T cells are typically treated with the   cytokine     interleukin 2    IL-2  and anti-                   CD3   antibodies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Anti-CD3 CD28 antibodies are also used in some protocols.                 

The expanded T cells are purified and then                           transduced   with a gene encoding the engineered CAR via a                retroviral vector  , typically either an integrating   gammaretrovirus    RV  or a              lentiviral    LV  vector.                  These vectors are very safe in modern times due to a partial deletion of the U3 region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The new gene editing tool                                       CRISPR Cas9   has recently been used instead of retroviral vectors to integrate the CAR gene into specific sites in the genome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

The patient undergoes lymphodepletion   chemotherapy   prior to the introduction of the engineered CAR T-cells.                           The depletion of the number of circulating leukocytes in the patient upregulates the number of cytokines that are produced and reduces competition for resources, which helps to promote the expansion of the engineered CAR T-cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

   Clinical applications   
As of March 2019, there were around 364 ongoing clinical trials happening globally involving CAR T cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The majority of those trials target blood cancers: CAR T therapies account for more than half of all trials for hematological malignancies.                      CD19 continues to be the most popular antigen target,                                                                                                                                                    followed by BCMA  commonly expressed in   multiple myeloma   .                                                                                                                                                                In 2016, studies began to explore the viability of other antigens, such as CD20.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Trials for solid tumors are less dominated by CAR T, with about half of cell therapy-based trials involving other platforms such as                       NK cells  .                     

    Cancer    
T cells are genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors specifically directed toward antigens on a patient's tumor cells, then infused into the patient where they attack and kill the cancer cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Adoptive transfer   of T cells expressing CARs is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic, because CAR-modified T cells can be engineered to target potentially any   tumor associated antigen  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Early CAR T cell research has focused on                                                    blood cancers  . The first approved treatments use CARs that target the antigen   CD19  , present in B-cell-derived cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  and   diffuse large B-cell lymphoma    DLBCL .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   There are also efforts underway to engineer CARs targeting many other blood cancer antigens, including   CD30   in refractory   Hodgkin's lymphoma  ;   CD33  ,   CD123  , and   FLT3   in   acute myeloid leukemia    AML ; and                             BCMA   in   multiple myeloma  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

CAR T cells have also been found to be effective in treating glioblastoma.  A single infusion is enough to show rapid tumor regression in a matter of days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Solid tumors have presented a more difficult target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Identification of good antigens has been challenging: such antigens must be highly expressed on the majority of cancer cells, but largely absent on normal tissues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          CAR T cells are also not trafficked efficiently into the center of solid tumor masses, and the                                              hostile tumor microenvironment   suppresses T cell activity.                          

    Autoimmune disease    
While most CAR T cell studies focus on creating a CAR T cell that can eradicate a certain cell population  for instance, CAR T cells that target lymphoma cells , there are other potential uses for this technology. T cells can also mediate tolerance to antigens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A   regulatory T cell   outfitted with a CAR could have the potential to confer tolerance to a specific antigen, something that could be utilized in organ transplantation or rheumatologic diseases like   lupus  .

   Safety   
There are serious side effects that result from CAR T-cells being introduced into the body, including   cytokine release syndrome   and neurological toxicity.                            Because it is a relatively new treatment, there are few data about the long-term effects of CAR T-cell therapy. There are still concerns about long-term patient survival, as well as pregnancy complications in female patients treated with CAR T-cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Anaphylaxis   may be a side effect, as the CAR is made with a foreign   monoclonal antibody  , and as a result provokes an immune response.                                   

On-target off-tumor recognition occurs when the CAR T-cell recognizes the correct antigen, but the antigen is expressed on healthy, non-pathogenic tissue. This results in the CAR T-cells attacking non-tumor tissue, such as healthy B cells that express CD19 causing B-cell   aplasia  . The severity of this adverse effect can vary but the combination of prior immunosuppression, lymphodepleting chemotherapy and on-target effects causing hypogammaglobulinaemia and prolonged cytopenias places patients at increased risk of serious infections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

There is also the unlikely possibility that the engineered CAR T-cells will themselves become transformed into cancerous cells through   insertional mutagenesis  , due to the viral vector inserting the CAR gene into a   tumor suppressor   or   oncogene   in the host T cell's genome. Some retroviral  RV  vectors carry a lower risk than lentiviral  LV  vectors. However, both have the potential to be oncogenic. Genomic sequencing analysis of CAR insertion sites in T cells has been established for better understanding of CAR T-cell function and persistence in vivo.                 

    Cytokine release syndrome    
  Main Cytokine release syndrome  
The most common issue after treatment with CAR T-cells is cytokine release syndrome  CRS , a condition in which the immune system is activated and releases an increased number of inflammatory cytokines. The clinical manifestation of this syndrome resembles   sepsis   with high fever, fatigue,   myalgia  , nausea, capillary leakages,   tachycardia   and other cardiac dysfunction, liver failure, and kidney impairment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         CRS occurs in almost all patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy; in fact, the presence of CRS is a diagnostic marker that indicates the CAR T-cells are working as intended to kill the cancer cells.                  The severity of CRS does not correlate with an increased response to the treatment, but rather higher disease burden.                  Severe cytokine release syndrome can be managed with                          immunosuppressants   such as   corticosteroid  s, and with   tocilizumab  , an   anti-IL-6   monoclonal antibody.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Early intervention using tocilizumab was shown to reduce the frequency of severe CRS in multiple studies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             without affecting the therapeutic effect of the treatment. A novel strategy aimed to ameliorate CRS is based on the simultaneous expression of an artificial non-signaling IL-6 receptor on the surface of CAR T-cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This construct neutralizes macrophage-derived IL-6 through sequestration, thus decreasing the severity of CRS without interfering with the antitumor capability of the CAR T-cell itself.

    Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity    
Neurological toxicity is also often associated with CAR T-cell treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The underlying mechanism is poorly understood, and may or may not be related to CRS. Clinical manifestations include delirium, the partial loss of the ability to speak coherently while still having the ability to interpret language    expressive aphasia   , lowered alertness    obtundation   , and seizures.                  During some clinical trials, deaths caused by neurotoxicity have occurred. The main cause of death from neurotoxicity is   cerebral edema  . In a study carried out by Juno Therapeutics, Inc., five patients enrolled in the trial died as a result of cerebral edema. Two of the patients were treated with   cyclophosphamide   alone and the remaining three were treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide and   fludarabine  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           In another clinical trial sponsored by the   Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  , there was one reported case of irreversible and fatal neurological toxicity 122 days after the administration of CAR T-cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

Hypokinetic movement disorder  parkinsonism, or movement and neurocognitive treatment emergent adverse events  has been observed with BCMA-chimeric antigen receptor  CAR  T-cell treatment for multiple myeloma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

   Chimeric antigen receptor structure   
Chimeric antigen receptors combine many facets of normal                     T cell activation   into a single protein. They link an extracellular antigen recognition domain to an intracellular signalling domain, which activates the T cell when an antigen is bound. CARs are composed of four regions: an antigen recognition domain, an extracellular hinge region, a   transmembrane domain  , and an intracellular T cell signaling domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

  File:CAR cartoon.png 180px right thumb Different components of a chimeric antigen receptor  

    Antigen recognition domain    
The antigen recognition domain is exposed to the outside of the cell, in the ectodomain portion of the receptor. It interacts with potential target molecules and is responsible for targeting the CAR T cell to any cell expressing a matching molecule.                                   

The antigen recognition domain is typically derived from the variable regions of a   monoclonal antibody   linked together as a single-chain variable fragment  scFv .                         An scFv is a chimeric protein made up of the light  V sub L  sub   and heavy  V sub H  sub   chains of   immunoglobin  s, connected with a short linker peptide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             These V sub L  sub  and V sub H  sub  regions are selected in advance for their binding ability to the target antigen  such as CD19 . The linker between the two chains consists of   hydrophilic   residues with stretches of   glycine   and   serine   in it for flexibility as well as stretches of   glutamate   and   lysine   for added solubility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Single domain antibodies  e.g. V sub H  sub , V sub H  sub H, V sub NAR  sub   have been engineered and developed as antigen recognition domains in the CAR format due to their high transduction efficiency in T cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

In addition to antibody fragments, non-antibody-based approaches have also been used to direct CAR specificity, usually taking advantage of ligand receptor pairs that normally bind to each other.                            Cytokines, innate immune receptors, TNF receptors, growth factors, and structural proteins have all been successfully used as CAR antigen recognition domains.                           

    Hinge region    
The hinge, also called a spacer, is a small structural domain that sits between the antigen recognition region and the cell's outer membrane. An ideal hinge enhances the flexibility of the scFv receptor head, reducing the spatial constraints between the CAR and its target antigen. This promotes antigen binding and synapse formation between the CAR T cells and target cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Hinge sequences are often based on membrane-proximal regions from other immune molecules including                    IgG  ,   CD8  , and   CD28  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

    Transmembrane domain    

The transmembrane domain is a structural component, consisting of a   hydrophobic     alpha helix   that spans the cell membrane. It anchors the CAR to the plasma membrane, bridging the extracellular hinge and antigen recognition domains with the intracellular signaling region.                            This domain is essential for the stability of the receptor as a whole. Generally, the transmembrane domain from the most membrane-proximal component of the endodomain is used, but different transmembrane domains result in different receptor stability. The CD28 transmembrane domain is known to result in a highly expressed, stable receptor.                  

Using the CD3-zeta transmembrane domain is not recommended, as it can result in incorporation of the artificial                   TCR   into the native TCR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

    Intracellular T cell signaling domain    
  File:Depiction of 3 generations of CARs.jpg thumb Depiction of first, second, and third generation chimeric antigen receptors with the scFv segments in green and the various intracellular TCR signaling components in red, blue and yellow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The intracellular T cell signaling domain lies in the receptor's endodomain, inside the cell.                            After an antigen is bound to the external antigen recognition domain, CAR receptors cluster together and transmit an activation signal. Then the internal cytoplasmic end of the receptor perpetuates signaling inside the T cell.                 

Normal T cell activation relies on the phosphorylation of   immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif  s  ITAMs  present in the cytoplasmic domain of                    CD3-zeta  . To mimic this process, CD3-zeta's cytoplasmic domain is commonly used as the main CAR endodomain component. Other ITAM-containing domains have also been tried, but are not as effective.                        

T cells also require                  co-stimulatory   molecules in addition to CD3 signaling in order to persist after activation. For this reason, the endodomains of CAR receptors typically also include one or more chimeric domains from co-stimulatory proteins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Signaling domains from a wide variety of co-stimulatory molecules have been successfully tested, including CD28,   CD27  ,        CD134  OX40   , and         CD137  4-1BB   .                           

The intracellular signaling domain used defines the generation of a CAR T cell.                           First generation CARs include only a CD3-zeta cytoplasmic domain.                           Second generation CARs add a co-stimulatory domain, like CD28 or 4-1BB. The involvement of these intracellular signaling domains improve T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, resistance to apoptosis, and in vivo persistence.                           Third generation CARs combine multiple co-stimulatory domains, such as CD28-41BB or CD28-OX40, to augment T cell activity. Preclinical data show the third-generation CARs exhibit improved effector functions and better in vivo persistence as compared to second-generation CARs.                          

   Research directions   

    Antigen recognition    
Although the initial clinical remission rates after CAR T cell therapy in all patients are as high as 90 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              long-term survival rates are much lower. The cause is typically the emergence of leukemia cells that do not express CD19 and so evade recognition by the CD19 CAR T cells, a phenomenon known as                    antigen escape  .                           Preclinical studies developing CAR T cells with dual targeting of CD19 plus CD22 or CD19 plus CD20 have demonstrated promise, and trials studying bispecific targeting to circumvent CD19 down-regulation are ongoing.                          

In 2018, a version of CAR was developed that is referred to as SUPRA CAR, or split, universal, and programmable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Multiple mechanisms can be deployed to finely regulate the activity of SUPRA CAR, which limits overactivation. In contrast to the traditional CAR design, SUPRA CAR allows targeting of multiple antigens without further genetic modification of a person's immune cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Treatment of antigenically heterogeneous tumors can be achieved by administration of a mixture of the desired antigen-specific adaptors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

    CAR T function    
Fourth generation CARs  also known as TRUCKs or armored CARs  further add factors that enhance T cell expansion, persistence, and anti-tumoral activity. This can include cytokines, such is                 IL-2  ,                  IL-5  ,                  IL-12   and co-stimulatory ligands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

    Control mechanisms    
Adding a synthetic control mechanism to engineered T cells allows doctors to precisely control the persistence or activity of the T cells in the patient's body, with the goal of reducing toxic side effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The major control techniques trigger T cell death or limit T cell activation, and often regulate the T cells via a separate drug that can be introduced or withheld as needed.                                   

'''  Suicide gene  s''': Genetically modified T cells are engineered to include one or more genes that can induce   apoptosis   when activated by an extracellular molecule. Herpes simplex virus   thymidine kinase    HSV-TK  and inducible           caspase 9    iCasp9  are two types of suicide genes that have been integrated into CAR T cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In the iCasp9 system, the suicide gene complex has two elements: a mutated FK506-binding protein with high specificity to the small molecule rimiducid AP1903, and a gene encoding a pro-domain-deleted human caspase 9. Dosing the patient with rimiducid activates the suicide system, leading to rapid apoptosis of the genetically modified T cells. Although both the HSV-TK and iCasp9 systems demonstrate a noticeable function as a safety switch in clinical trials, some defects limit their application. HSV-TK is virus-derived and may be immunogenic to humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It is also currently unclear whether the suicide gene strategies will act quickly enough in all situations to halt dangerous off-tumor cytotoxicity.                                   

'''Dual-antigen receptor''': CAR T cells are engineered to express two tumor-associated antigen receptors at the same time, reducing the likelihood that the T cells will attack non-tumor cells. Dual-antigen receptor CAR T cells have been reported to have less intense side effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  An in vivo study in mice shows that dual-receptor CAR T cells effectively eradicated prostate cancer and achieved complete long-term survival.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

'''ON-switch and OFF-switch''': In this system, CAR T cells can only function in the presence of both tumor antigen and a benign exogenous molecule. To achieve this, the CAR T cell's engineered chimeric antigen receptor is split into two separate proteins that must come together in order to function. The first receptor protein typically contains the extracellular antigen binding domain, while the second protein contains the downstream signaling elements and co-stimulatory molecules  such as CD3ζ and 4-1BB .  In the presence of an exogenous molecule  such as a rapamycin analog , the binding and signaling proteins dimerize together, allowing the CAR T cells to attack the tumor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Human EGFR truncated form  hEGFRt  has been used as an OFF-switch for CAR T cells using   cetuximab  .                                                    

'''Bispecific molecules as switches''': Bispecific molecules target both a tumor-associated antigen and the CD3 molecule on the surface of T cells. This ensures that the T cells cannot become activated unless they are in close physical proximity to a tumor cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The anti-CD20 CD3 bispecific molecule shows high specificity to both malignant B cells and cancer cells in mice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   FITC   is another bifunctional molecule used in this strategy. FITC can redirect and regulate the activity of the FITC-specific CAR T cells toward tumor cells with folate receptors.

   Economics   
The cost of CAR T cell therapies has been criticized, with the initial costs of tisagenlecleucel  Kymriah  and axicabtagene ciloleucel  Yescarta  being  375,000 and  475,000 respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The high cost of CAR T therapies is due to complex cellular manufacturing in specialized   good manufacturing practice    GMP  facilities as well as the high level of hospital care necessary after CAR T cells are administered due to risks such as cytokine release syndrome.                  In the United States, CAR T cell therapies are covered by                            Medicare   and by many but not all private insurers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Manufacturers of CAR T cells have developed alternative payment programs due to the high cost of CAR T therapy, such as by requiring payment only if the CAR T therapy induces a complete remission by a certain time point after treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Additionally, CAR T cell therapies are not available worldwide yet. CAR T cell therapies have been approved in China, Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and some European countries.
