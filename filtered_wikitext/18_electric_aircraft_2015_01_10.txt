An '''electric aircraft''' is an [[aircraft]] that runs on [[electric motor]]s rather than [[internal combustion engine]]s, with [[electricity]] coming from [[fuel cell]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[ultracapacitors]], [[power beaming]],                                                                                           or [[battery (electricity)|batteries]].

Currently flying electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators, including manned and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s. [[Model aircraft#Electric power|Electrically powered model aircraft]] have been flown since the 1970s, with one report in 1957.                   The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973.                  

==History==
In 1883, [[Gaston Tissandier]] was the first to use electric motors in [[airship]] propulsion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The following year, [[Charles Renard]] and [[Arthur Constantin Krebs|Arthur Krebs]] flew [[La France (airship)|La France]] with a more powerful motor.                     

Electric motors have been used for model fixed-wing aircraft since from at least 1957, with a challenged claim from 1909.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

In 1964, [[William C. Brown]] demonstrates on CBS News with Walter Cronkite a model helicopter that receives all of the power needed for flight from a microwave beam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

In 1973, [[Fred Militky]] and [[Heino Brditschka]] converted a [[Brditschka HB-3]] [[motor glider]] to an electric aircraft, the [[Militky MB-E1]], the first man carrying, full size aircraft to fly under solely under electric power. Heino flew it for 14 minutes that same year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

In 2007, the non-profit [[CAFE Foundation]] held the first Electric Aircraft Symposium in San Francisco.                                                                                                                                  
The first electric registered aircraft makes its first flights the 2007-12-23 : BL1E "Electra" (F-PMDJ).                                                                                                                                             

In 2009, a team from the Turin Polytechnic University made a conversion of a Pioneer Alpi 300. It flew 250&nbsp;km/h for 14 minutes.                                                                                                      

By 2011, the use of electric power for aircraft was gaining momentum. At [[AirVenture]] in that year the ''Electric Aircraft World Symposium'' was held and attracted wide attention. It was sponsored by [[GE Aviation]] and included presentations by [[US Air Force]], [[NASA]], [[Sikorsky Aircraft]], Argonne National Labs and the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

==Experimental projects==

===1970s and 1980s===

====Militky MB-E1====
In 1973 the [[West Germany|West German]] [[Militky MB-E1]] became the first man-carrying, full-size aircraft to fly solely on electric power. It used Ni-Cd batteries and a {{convert|10|kW|hp|abbr=on}} DC motor, which gave it a duration of over 12 minutes.                  

====Sunrise====
The {{convert|27|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} unmanned [[AstroFlight Sunrise]], the result of an ARPA contract, made the world's first solar-powered flight from Bicycle Lake, a dry lakebed on the [[Fort Irwin Military Reservation]], on 4 November 1974. The improved Sunrise II flew on 27 September 1975 at [[Nellis Air Force Base]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

====Solar Riser====
The world’s first official flight in a solar-powered, man-carrying aircraft took place on April 29, 1979. The [[Mauro Solar Riser]] was built by [[Larry Mauro]] and was based on the [[UFM Easy Riser]] biplane [[hang glider]]. The aircraft used photovoltaic cells that produced 350 watts at 30 volts, which charged a [[Hughes 500]] helicopter battery, which in turn powered the electric motor. The aircraft was capable of powering the motor for 3 to 5 minutes, following a 1.5-hour charge, enabling it to reach a gliding altitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

====Solar One====
The [[Solar-Powered Aircraft Developments Solar One]] was designed by David Williams under the direction of Freddie To, an architect and member of the [[Kremer prize]] committee and produced by [[Solar-Powered Aircraft Developments]]. A motor-glider type aircraft originally built as a pedal-powered airplane to attempt the Channel crossing, the airplane proved too heavy to be successfully powered by human power and was then converted to solar power,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      using an electric motor driven by batteries that were charged before flight by a solar cell array on the wing.                                                                                                                                                                                                             The maiden flight of Solar One took place at Lasham Airfield; Hampshire on June 13, 1979.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

====Gossamer Penguin and Solar Challenger====
The [[Gossamer Penguin]], a smaller version of the human-powered [[Gossamer Albatross]] was completely solar-powered. A second prototype, the [[Solar Challenger]], flew {{convert|262|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Paris to England.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          On 7 July 1981, the aircraft, under solar-power, flew 163 miles from Cormeilles-en-Vexin Airport near [[Paris]] across the [[English Channel]] to [[RAF Manston]] near [[London]], flying for 5 hours and 23 minutes. Designed by Dr. [[Paul MacCready]] the Solar Challenger set an altitude record of 14,300 feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

====MIT Monarch and Monarch-B====
The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [[MIT Monarch|Monarch]]                                                                                                                                              aircraft project was a series of two aircraft designed to win the [[Kremer prize]] for [[human-powered aircraft]] speed record. The aircraft used an electrical motor along with batteries which were charged by the pedalling action of an athlete piloting the aircraft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

====Aerovironment Bionic Bat====
The [[Aerovironment]] Bionic Bat was an aircraft built to compete for the Kremer Speed Challenge, one in a series of [[Kremer prize]] offerings administered by the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]. It incorporated an electric motor that doubled as a generator while on the ground, with the pilot's pedaling action charging ni-cad batteries. The stored energy was used to supplement pedal power from the pilot during record attempts. In 1984, Bionic Bat won two segments of the Kremer Speed Challenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

====Solair 1====
The human piloted Solair 1 was developed by Günther Rochelt and based on a [[Hans Farner]] [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It employed 2499 wing-mounted solar cells, giving an output of between 1.8 [[kilowatts]] (kW). This was equivalent to approximately 2.4 [[horsepower]] (hp), and {{convert|2.2|kW|hp|1|abbr=on}}. The aircraft first flew at [[Unterwössen]], [[Germany]] on 21 August 1983.                   It flew for 5 hours and 41 minutes, "mostly on solar energy and also thermals".                   The aircraft is now displayed at the German Museum in [[Munich]].                      The newly developed piloted Solair II made its first flight in May 1998 and further test flights that summer but the propulsion system overheated too fast.                      Development stopped when Günther Rochelt suddenly died in September 1998.

[[NASA Pathfinder|NASA's Pathfinder, Pathfinder Plus]], [[NASA Centurion|Centurion]], and [[NASA Helios|Helios]] were a series of solar and fuel cell system–powered unmanned aircraft developed by [[AeroVironment]], Inc. from 1983 until 2003 under [[NASA]]'s [[Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology]] program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  On September 11, 1995, Pathfinder set an unofficial altitude record for solar-powered aircraft of {{convert|50000|ft|m}} during a 12 hour flight from [[Dryden Flight Research Center|NASA Dryden]].                       After further modifications, the aircraft was moved to the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[Pacific Missile Range Facility]] (PMRF) on the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai]]. On July 7, 1997, Pathfinder raised the altitude record for solar–powered aircraft to {{convert|71530|ft|m}}, which was also the record for propeller–driven aircraft.                      

On August 6, 1998, Pathfinder Plus raised the national altitude record to {{convert|80201|ft|m}} for solar-powered and propeller-driven aircraft.                                                                                                                                 

On August 14, 2001 Helios set an altitude record of {{convert|96,863|ft|m}} – the record for FAI class U (Experimental / New Technologies), and FAI class U-1.d (Remotely controlled UAV: Weight 500&nbsp;kg to less than 2,500&nbsp;kg) as well as the altitude record for propeller–driven aircraft.                                                                                                                                                                                                 On June 26, 2003, the Helios Prototype broke up and fell into the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii after the aircraft encountered turbulence, ending the program.

====Sunseeker====
During the summer of 1990, the solar-powered airplane ''Sunseeker'', piloted by [[Eric Scott Raymond|Eric Raymond]], became the first solar-powered airplane to cross the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                It used a small battery pack charged by solar cells on the wings for takeoff, and then was able to fly directly on solar power.                                                                                                                                                                                     

The ''Sunseeker II'', built in 2002, was updated in 2005–2006 with a more powerful motor, larger wing, lithium battery packs and updated control electronics.                                                                                                                                    As of Dec, 2008 it was the only manned solar-powered airplane in flying condition and was flown regularly by Solar Flight.                         In 2009 it became the first solar-powered aircraft to cross the [[Alps]], 99 years after the first crossing of the Alps by an aircraft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

====Soaring====

[[Image:Summary of Configuration and Performance Parameter of “Soaring”.jpg|thumb|right|Summary of Configuration and Performance Parameter of “Soaring”]]
China's first solar-powered aircraft "Soaring" was designed and built by Danny H. Y. Li and Zhao Yong in 1992. The body and wings are hand-built predominantly of [[carbon fiber]], [[Kevlar]] and wood. The design uses [[winglet]]s to increase the effective wing span and reduce induced drag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

====Icaré II====
The German solar-powered aircraft "Icaré II" was designed and built by the institute of aircraft design (Institut für Flugzeugbau) of the University of Stuttgart in 1996. The leader of the project and often pilot of the aircraft is Rudolf Voit-Nitschmann the head of the institute. The design won the Berblinger prize in 1996, the EAA Special Achievement Award in Oshkosh, the Golden Daidalos Medal of the German Aeroclub and the OSTIV-Prize in France in 1997.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

====LF20====
Built by Lange Flugzeugbau GmbH, the LF20                                                                                                                                                                                                                         was a heavily modified DG800. First flown on 7 May 1999, the aircraft was used as a flying testbed and technology demonstrator. Powered by NiMh cells and using the same EA42 propulsion system as the later Antares 20E, the LF20 could climb 1725 m on one charge.

===2000s===

====Antares 20E and 23E====
The [[Antares 20E]] is an electric, self-launching 20-meter [[sailplane]] with a 42-[[kW]] DC/DC brushless motor and [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]. It can climb up to 3,000 meters with fully charged cells.                                                                                                                                                The first flight was in 2003. The Antares 20E was the first aircraft with an electric propulsion system to obtain a certificate of airworthiness. In 2011 the aircraft won the 2011 Berblinger competition,                                                                                                                                 an ambitious aerial challenge for “green” aircraft. The [[Antares 23E]] is a 23-meter version of the 20E featuring a wider range of wing-loading and higher performance, using the same propulsion system as the 20E and Arcus E. The [[Antares 23E]] first flew in December 2011, with series production commencing in early 2012.                                     

====Alan Cocconi and the SoLong====
In 2005, [[Alan Cocconi]], who founded the California (USA) electric-propulsion research company [[AC Propulsion]], flew, with the assistance of several other pilots, an unmanned airplane named "SoLong" for 48 hours non-stop, propelled entirely by solar energy. This was the first such around-the-clock flight, on energy stored in the batteries mounted on the plane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

====Solar Impulse====
[[File:Flea Hop HB-SIA - Solar Impulse.jpg|thumb| [[Solar Impulse]] made its first "flea hop" test flight on December 2009]]
{{Main|Solar Impulse Project}}

The first short-hop (350 m) test flight of the [[Solar Impulse]] prototype was made on 3 December 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                            

In its present configuration it has a wingspan of {{convert|210|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, weighs {{convert|3500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and is powered by four {{convert|10|hp|kW|0|adj=on}} electric motors. The aircraft has over 11,000 solar cells on its wings and horizontal stabilizer. Power from the solar cells is stored in lithium polymer batteries and used to drive {{convert|3.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} propellers turning at a speed of 200–400 rpm. Take-off speed is {{convert|19|kn|km/h|0}} and cruising speed is {{convert|30|kn|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

The aircraft had its first high flight on 7 April 2010, when it flew to an altitude of {{convert|1,200|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in a 1.5-hour flight on battery power alone. The Solar Impulse team is planning to use a larger single-place aircraft to circumnavigate the globe in segments with a series of flights in 2015.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

The aircraft first flew on purely solar power, charging its batteries in flight, on 28 May 2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

On 8 July 2010 it completed the first manned 24-hour flight completely powered by solar power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

On 5 June 2012, the Solar Impulse successfully completed an intercontinental flight, the first-ever by a solar plane, flying a 19-hour trip from [[Madrid]], Spain, to [[Rabat]], Morocco.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

On 23 May 2013 the aircraft completed the second leg of its trip across the United States and landed at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]]. This set a new world distance record for solar aviation.

In July 2011 the aircraft flew for over two hours between two points near [[Mindelheim]], [[Germany]], at an average speed of more than {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

====ENFICA-FC====
The ENFICA-FC is a project of the [[European Commission]], to study and demonstrate an all-electric aircraft with fuel-cells as the main or auxiliary power system. During the three-year project, a fuel-cell based power system was designed and flown in a [[Rapid 200FC]] [[ultralight aircraft]].                                                                                    

==== Paratrike E-Fenix ====
[[Image:EFenix paratrike.jpg|thumb|E-Fenix : the first electric 2-seater paratrike in the world. Flying at Re Island]]
The E-Fenix was the first two-seat electric paratrike flown. Developed by Planète Sports & Loisirs, headquartered on Re Island, off the coast of [[La Rochelle, France]], with a complete [[Electravia]] electric solutiont, this paratrike is used since summer 2011 for tourist flying. The first flight took place on 12 May 2011 at Sisteron's airfield (South of France, headquarters of [[Electravia]]), with Michaël Morin as test pilot.                                                                                                                            

====Puffin====
The ''[[Puffin (aircraft)|Puffin]]'' is a proposed hover-capable, electric-powered, low-noise, personal, [[vertical takeoff and landing]] (VTOL) technology-concept, [[proprotor]] [[aircraft]]. It would be capable of flying a single person at a speed of 150 miles per hour. Range is expected to be less than 50 miles with initial [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|battery technology]]. The design has a 13.5-foot [[wingspan]] and stands 12 feet tall on the ground in its [[Tailsitter|take-off or landing configuration]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

{{asof|January 2010}}, a one third–size, hover-capable Puffin demonstrator was planned for March 2010. Future designs might incorporate additional rotors to provide redundant systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

{{asof|August 2010}}, the one-third scale model of the Puffin was on display at the [[NASA Langley]] campus for filming for the [[Discovery network]] series “[[Dean of Invention]].”                                                                                                                                                                The Puffin [[simulator]] was also demonstrated.  The Puffin will appear in the eighth and final episode of the show.                                                                                                                                                                   

====Pipistrel Taurus G4====
In July 2011 [[Pipistrel]] unveiled their [[Pipistrel Taurus|Taurus G4]] dual fuselage, four seat, single engine experimental aircraft that demonstrated the equivalent of 400 [[passenger miles per gallon]] efficiency. The aircraft joins two sailplane fuselages, with two seats each, with a single [[tractor configuration]] electric motor mounted between the fuselages. The aircraft carries {{convert|1100|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of Lithium polymer batteries. The aircraft has a {{convert|75|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wing and has a gross take-off weight of {{convert|3300|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, making it the heaviest manned electric-powered aircraft built to date. It has a [[glide ratio]] of over 30:1 at {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The G4 first flew on 12 August 2011 and won the NASA Green Flight Challenge on 3 October 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

====Luxembourg Special Aerotechnics MC30E====
[[Image:MC30E-LSA-08-2011.jpg|thumb|The MC30E during flight test campaign of August 2011]]
On 13 April 2011, during the [[AERO Friedrichshafen]] show, the [[Luxembourg Special Aerotechnics MC30E]] proof-of-concept aircraft                                                                              piloted by Jean Luc-Soullier, using Dow Kokam Li-Po batteries, set a record for electric aircraft of {{convert|135|km/h|kn|0|abbr=on}} over a return {{convert|15|km|nmi|0|abbr=on}} circuit in the FAI RAL1E category (FAI ID 16214) which was not approved solely for file format reason. This aircraft was later retrofitted with a more efficient engine from [[Electravia]], in order to pursue further records in 2011.                                                                 Since this time the FAI registered four records in speed, distance and altitude, flown 27 February 2012                                                                                                                              (FAI ID 16 495,16496 and 16497) and 29th september 2012 (FAI ID 16638).

====Electric Lazair====
In 2011, [[Ultraflight Lazair]] designer Dale Kramer introduced an experimental electric-powered Lazair on an amphibious mono-float, with outrigger floats at [[AirVenture]]. The aircraft is powered by twin Bevirt JM1 Joby [[model aircraft]] powerplants and dual 16 cell 4 amp-hour battery packs that produce 63 volts, mounted in the wings. The aircraft won ''Antique Ultralight Champion'' and Best ''Ultralight Amphibian'' at AirVenture. The aircraft is an experimental project and no production is planned.                                                                                                                                                                                           

==== Electric Rotorcraft ====
The [[Solution F/Chretien Helicopter]]
the world's first man-carrying, free-flying electric helicopter was developed by [[Pascal Chretien]]. The concept was taken from the conceptual [[computer-aided design]] model on September 10, 2010 to the first testing at 30% power on March 1, 2011—less than six months. The aircraft first flew on August 12, 2011. All development was conducted in Venelles, France.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
[[File:Hover OGE 1.JPG|thumbnail|right|Pascal Chretien hovering world's first manned electric helicopter on 12 August 2011]]

The electric Sikorsky S-300 of the [[Project Firefly]] was a project to flight test an electric rotorcraft, but the project was put on hold due to battery limitations.                                                                                                                                          

The world's first large-scale all-electric [[tilt-rotor]] was the [[AgustaWestland Project Zero]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] technology demonstrator, which performed unmanned tethered fights on ground power in June 2011, less than six months after the company gave the official go-ahead.

The first commercially available production electric aircraft was the [[Alisport Silent Club]] self-launching sailplane. It was first tested in 1997. It is optionally driven by a {{convert|13|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} DC electric motor running on {{convert|40|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} of batteries that store 1.4 kWh of energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

==== Air Energy AE-1 Silent ====
The [[Air Energy AE-1 Silent]] came on the market in 1998.

===2000s===

====Electraflyer====
In April 2007 the [[Electric Aircraft Corporation]] began offering complete electric ultralights and engine kits under the [[ElectraFlyer]] brand name, to convert existing [[ultralight aircraft]] to electric power, in what was the first commercial offering of an electric aircraft.

The {{convert|18|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine package weighs 26&nbsp;lbs and an efficiency of 90% is claimed by the company. The battery consists of two [[lithium-polymer battery]] packs which provides 1.5 hours of flying in the [[trike]] application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

In January 2008 the company introduced their new [[ElectraFlyer-C]] at the [[Sebring Light Sport Aircraft Show]]. This aircraft is a converted [[Monnett Moni]] [[motor glider]] equipped with an 18-hp electric motor, regenerative-braking-capable controller package and two lithium polymer battery packs. The engine weighs 29&nbsp;lbs and the battery packs weigh 78&nbsp;lbs total. The aircraft has a climb rate of 500&nbsp;ft/min, cruise of 70&nbsp;mph and an endurance of 90 minutes. It is capable of being recharged from a 110-volt source in six hours or from a 220 volt source in two hours. The aircraft began flying in May 2008 and was demonstrated before the crowds on August 2 at [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|AirVenture]] 2008.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

In April 2009 the ElectraFlyer-C prototype was offered for sale on [[eBay]]. The designer intended to use the funds from the sale, plus a [[Lindbergh Foundation]] grant of $10,580 to complete the two-place [[Electric Aircraft Corporation ElectraFlyer-X]] design that will eventually qualify for [[light-sport aircraft]] status. The new design will incorporate composite construction, detachable [[wingtip]]s to aid storage and will be powered by a {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} electric motor. Its design goals include a 28:1 [[glide ratio]] and a cruise speed of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} for two hours.

The Canadian Green1 electric motor glider trike was developed by [[eUP Aviation]] with a complete [[Electravia]] electric solution and had its inaugural flight on 8 December 2012 at [[Pitt Meadows Airport]] in British Columbia. Powered by a {{convert|19|kW|hp|abbr=on}} electric motor and a 3.9 kWh lithium polymer battery, the single place ultralight with a hang gliding wing is capable of one hour of power flight which can be supplemented for greater time and distance with power-off soaring. Production delivery is forecast for the spring of 2013.                                                                                                                                                                   

==Future electric aircraft==

===2030 - 2040===
Recently proposed electric aircraft concepts for the future, feature unconventional and rather radical propulsion systems such as [[distributed propulsion]] technology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             or electrothermal turbopropulsion (Turboarcjet).                                                                                                                                                                                                  Turboelectric power transfer in these propulsion arrangements contribute to energy conservation and feasible electric aircraft systems. Despite the aforementioned benefits, future electric aircraft concepts are also faced with a number of notable challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      that are currently addressed by analysis tools such as ELECTERA. ELECTERA is a novel techno economic risk analysis scheme for future electric aircraft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This scheme is proposed for initial design assessments of novel electric aircraft concepts at preliminary design stages.

Another proposed electric aircraft concept is the [[EADS VoltAir]]. It could be made within 25 years and features liquid nitrogen cooling for the engine.
