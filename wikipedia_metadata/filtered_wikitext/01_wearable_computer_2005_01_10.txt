A '''wearable computer''' is a small   portable computer   that is designed to be worn on the body during use. In this wearable computers differ from                              PDAs  , which are designed for hand-held use. Wearable computers are usually either integrated into the user's   clothing   or can be attached to the body through some other means, like a wristband. They may also be integrated into everyday objects that are constantly worn on the body, like a   wrist     watch   or a hands-free   cell phone  .

The aim of wearable computing                        community   is to develop new   user interface  s that mediate  augment, deliberately diminish, or otherwise modify  non-computer activities, without interfering with the user's everyday tasks. The design of wearable computers is still a topic of   research  , and a variety of user interfaces are being proposed.  

The commercialization of wearable computing has been led by companies such as   Xybernaut  ,   HandyKey  , and   ViA  .  Publicly-traded Xybernaut has forged alliances with companies such as   IBM   and   Sony   in order to make wearable computing widely available. In 1998   Seiko   marketed the   Ruputer  , a computer in a  fairly large  wristwatch, to mediocre returns. In 2001   IBM   developed and publicly displayed two prototypes for a wristwatch computer running Linux, but the product never came to market. In 2002   Fossil   announced the Fossil WristPDA, which ran the   PalmOS  . Its release date was set for summer of 2003, but was delayed several times and eventually pushed back indefinitely.

Some wearable computers use         keyers    keyswitches mounted to a grip, rather than to a board, as with a keyboard  and trackballs as input devices, but many try to use more intuitive means of input like                        gesture  ,   speech recognition   or   context awareness  . The output may be presented through displays, lights, sound or even   haptic   interfaces. Some                    mediated reality                        augmented  , diminished, or otherwise modified reality  systems can also be considered wearable computers.

Wearable computers of the 1970s were typically large, sometimes even requiring the user to wear a backpack. In the 1980s these systems were miniaturized to smart clothes  computer jackets  and eyeglasses, where the components were mounted outside the eyeglasses.  In the 1990s covert or normal-looking systems were developed that had the appearance of ordinary clothing and eyeglasses, by way of an underwearable computer  worn under a shirt  and EyeTap eyeglasses.  In 1998, a fully functional wristwatch computer system was designed and built, and later featured on the cover of Linux Journal.

  Steve Mann  's   wearcomp   has other properties such as '''operational constancy'''  the property that the computer is always on and ready for use .

The   United States Army   plans to issue 10,000 wearable computers to its combat troops in the next few years.  They have approved a robust design that will supposedly be immune to weather, temperature, and vibration extremes.  It consists of two belt-hung modules for power and processing, and an interface integrated with the regular combat helmet.
