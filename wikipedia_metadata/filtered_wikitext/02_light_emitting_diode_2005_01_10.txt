A '''  light  -emitting   diode    LED ''' is a   semiconductor   device that emits                       incoherent     monochromatic     light   when electrically biased in the forward direction.  This effect is a form of   electroluminescence  .  The color depends on the semiconducting material used, and can be near-  ultraviolet  ,                    visible   or   infrared  .                 Nick Holonyak Jr.    1928 ndash;   of the   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign   developed the first practical visible-spectrum LED in   1962  . http:  www.si.edu lemelson Quartz inventors holonyak.html 
   LED technology   

    Physical function    
An LED is a special type of   semiconductor     diode  .  Like a normal diode, it consists of a chip of semiconducting material impregnated, or ''doped'', with impurities to create a structure called a ''pn junction''.  Charge-carriers    electron  s and                 hole  s  are created by an electric                         current   passing through the junction. When an electron meets a hole, it falls into a lower   energy level  , and releases   energy   in the form of a   photon   as it does so.

    Light emission    

The   wavelength   of the light emitted, and therefore its color, depends on the   bandgap   energy of the materials forming the pn junction.  A normal diode, typically made of   silicon   or   germanium  , emits invisible far-infrared light, but the materials used for an LED have bandgap energies corresponding to near-infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet light.

    Considerations in use    

Unlike   incandescent light bulb  s, which can operate with either                       AC   or                  DC  , LEDs require a DC supply of the correct            electrical polarity  .  When the voltage across the pn junction is in the correct direction, a significant current flows and the device is said to be ''forward biased''.  The voltage across the LED in this case is fixed for a given LED and is proportional to the energy of the emitted photons.  If the voltage is of the wrong polarity, the device is said to be ''reverse biased'', very little current flows, and no light is emitted. 

Because the voltage versus current characteristics of an LED are much like any diode, they can be destroyed by connecting them to a voltage source much higher than their turn on voltage. A good LED driver circuit is either a constant current source or an approximation to a current source made by connecting the LED in series with a current limiting resistor to a voltage source. The voltage drop across a forward biased LED increases as the amount of light emitted increases because of the optical power being radiated. One consequence is that LEDs of the same type can be readily operated in parallel. The turn-on voltage of an LED is a function of the color, a higher forward drop is associated with emitting higher energy  bluer  photons. The reverse voltage that most LEDs can sustain without damage is usually only a few volts.

Some LED units contain two diodes, one in each direction  that is, two diodes in ''inverse parallel''  and each a different color  typically red and green , allowing two-color operation or a range of apparent colors to be created by altering the percentage of time the voltage is in each polarity. Other LED units contain two or more diodes  of different colors  arranged in either a ''common anode'' or ''common cathode'' configuration. These can be driven to different colors without reversing the polarity.

    LED materials    

LED development began with infrared and red devices made with gallium arsenide. Advances in materials science have made possible the production of devices with ever shorter   wavelength  s, producing light in a variety of colors. 

Conventional LEDs are made from a variety of inorganic minerals, producing the following colors:
   aluminium gallium arsenide    AlGaAs  - red and infrared
 gallium aluminium phosphide - green
 gallium arsenide phosphide  GaAsP  - red, orange-red, orange, and yellow
   gallium nitride    GaN  - green, pure green  or emerald green , and blue
 gallium phosphide  GaP  - red, yellow and green
   zinc              selenide    ZnSe  - blue
   indium   gallium nitride  InGaN  - bluish-green and blue
 indium gallium aluminium phosphide - orange-red, orange, yellow, and green
                   silicon carbide    SiC  - blue
   diamond    C  - ultraviolet
   silicon    Si  - under development

    Blue and white LEDs    

Commercially viable   blue   LEDs based on the wide bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride were invented by   Shuji Nakamura   while working in Japan at Nichia Corporation in   1993   and became widely available in the late   1990s  .  They can be added to existing red and green LEDs to produce   white   light.

Most  white  LEDs in production today use a 450nm   8211; 470nm blue GaN  gallium nitride  LED covered by a yellowish   phosphor   coating usually made of   cerium                             doped   yttrium aluminium garnet  YAG:Ce  crystals which have been powdered and bound in a type of viscous adhesive. The LED chip emits blue light, part of which is converted to yellow by the YAG:Ce. The single crystal form of YAG:Ce is actually considered a   scintillator   rather than a phosphor. Since yellow light stimulates the red and green receptors of the eye, the resulting mix of blue and yellow light gives the                appearance   of white.

White LEDs can also be made by coating near ultraviolet  NUV  emitting LEDs with a mixture of high efficiency   europium   based red and blue emitting phosphors plus green emitting copper and aluminium doped zinc sulfide  ZnS:Cu,Al . This is a method analogous to the way   fluorescent   lights work.

The newest method used to produce white light LEDs uses no phosphors at all and is based on homoepitaxially grown zinc selenide  ZnSe  on a ZnSe substrate which simultaneously emits blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate.

    Other colors    

Recent color developments include   pink   and   purple  .  They consist of one or two phosphor layers over a blue LED chip.  The first phosphor layer of a pink LED is a yellow glowing one, and the second phosphor layer is either red or orange glowing.  Purple LEDs are blue LEDs with an orange  glowing phosphor over the chip.  Some pink LEDs have run into issues.  For example, some are blue LEDs painted with fluorescent paint or fingernail polish that can wear off, and some are white LEDs with a pink phosphor or dye that unfortunately fades after a short time.

Ultraviolet, blue, pure green, white, pink and purple LEDs are relatively expensive compared to the more common reds, oranges, greens, yellows and infrareds and are thus less commonly used in commercial applications.

The semiconducting chip is encased in a solid   plastic     lens  , which is much tougher than the glass envelope of a traditional light bulb or tube.  The plastic may be colored, but this is only for cosmetic reasons and does not affect the color of the light emitted.

    Operational parameters and efficiency    

Most typical LEDs are designed to operate with no more than 30-60   milliwatt  s of electrical power.  Around   1999  , commercial LEDs capable of continuous use at one watt of input power were introduced.  These LEDs used much larger semiconductor die sizes to handle the large power input.  As well, the semiconductor dies were mounted to metal slugs to allow for heat removal from the LED die. In   2002  , 5-watt LEDs were available with efficiencies of 18-22                lumens   per watt. It is projected that by   2005  , 10-watt units will be available with efficiencies of 60 lumens per watt. These devices will produce about as much light as a common 50-watt   incandescent   bulb, and will facilitate use of LEDs for general illumination needs.

In September 2003 a new type of blue LED was demonstrated by the company Cree, Inc. to have 35  efficiency at 20 mA. This produced a commercially packaged white light having 65 lumens per watt at 20 mA, becoming the brightest white LED commercially available at the time.

In the last few years  up to   2003    there has been much research into        organic LEDs   or OLEDs, which are made of semiconducting   organic     polymer  s. The best efficiency of an OLED so far is about 10 .  These promise to be much cheaper to fabricate than inorganic LEDs, and large arrays of them can be deposited on a screen using simple printing methods to create a color graphic display.

    Organic light-emitting diodes  OLEDs     
If the emissive layer material of an LED is an   organic compound  , it is known as an Organic Light Emitting Diode    OLED   . To function as a semiconductor, the organic emissive material must have                     conjugated pi bonds  . The emissive material can be a small organic   molecule   in a           crystalline     phase  , or a   polymer  . Polymer materials can be flexible; such LEDs are known as PLEDs or FLEDs. 

Compared with regular LEDs, OLEDs are lighter and polymer LEDs can have the added benefit of being flexible. Some possible future applications of OLEDs could be: 

  Light sources
  Wall decorations
  Luminous   cloth  

   LED applications   

Here is a list of known applications for LEDs, some of which are further elaborated upon in the following text:

 in general, commonly used as information indicators in various types of   embedded system  s  many of which are listed below 
 thin, lightweight message displays, e.g. in public information signs  at airports and railway stations, among other places 
 status indicators, e.g. on off lights on professional instruments and consumers audio video equipment
   infrared   LEDs in   remote control  s  for TVs, VCRs, etc 
 clusters in   traffic signal  s, replacing ordinary bulbs behind colored glass
              car   indicator lights and   bicycle   lighting; also for pedestrians to be seen by car traffic
   calculator   and measurement instrument displays    seven segment display  s , although now mostly replaced by                          LCD  s
 red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and  alpha numeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits,   submarine   and ship bridges,   astronomy   observatories, and in the field, e.g. night time animal watching and military field use
 red or yellow LEDs are also used in photographic   darkroom  s, for providing lighting which does not lead to unwanted exposure of the film
 illumination, e.g.   flashlight  s  US    torches  UK , and   backlight  s for LCD screens
 signaling emergency beacons and strobes
 movement sensors, e.g. in mechanical and optical                  computer mice   and   trackball  s
 in LED printers, e.g. high-end color printers
   phototherapy  , the concept of using light for healing purposes

LEDs offer benefits in terms of maintenance and safety. The typical working lifetime of a device, including the bulb, is ten years, which is much longer than the lifetimes of most other light sources. Further, LEDs fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt burn-out of incandescent bulbs. LEDs give off less heat than incandescent   light bulb  s and are less fragile than   fluorescent lamp  s. Since an individual device is smaller than a   centimetre   in length, LED-based light sources used for illumination and outdoor signals are built using clusters of tens of devices.

  Incandescent light bulb  s for traffic signals and pedestrian crosswalks are gradually being replaced by LED clusters.

Lighting systems using              incandescent bulbs   are cheap to buy but inefficient, generating from about 16                lumen  s per   watt   for a domestic   tungsten   bulb to 22 lm W for a halogen bulb.                     Fluorescent tubes   are more efficient, from 50 to 100 lm W for domestic tubes, allowing large energy savings, but are bulky and fragile and require starter circuits.  LEDs are robust and moderately efficient, up to 32 lumens per watt, but are expensive, although their cost is falling.  The technologies for LED production are developing rapidly.

Because they are monochromatic, LED lights have great power advantages over white lights where a specific color is required. Unlike the white lights, the LED does not need a filter that absorbs most of the emitted white light. Colored fluorescent lights are made, but they are not widely available. LED lights are inherently colored, and are available in a wide range of colors. One of the most recently introduced colors is the emerald green  bluish green, about 500 nm  that  meets the legal requirements for traffic signals and navigation lights.

The largest LED display in the world is 36   metre  s high  118 feet , at   Times Square  ,   Manhattan  .

There are applications that specifically require light that does not contain any blue component. Examples are photographic darkroom safe lights, illumination in laboratories where certain photo-sensitive chemicals are used, and situations where dark adaptation  night vision  must be preserved, such as cockpit and bridge illumination, observatories, etc. Yellow LED lights are a good choice to meet these special requirements because the human eye is more sensitive to yellow light  about 500 lm watt ''emitted''  than that emitted by the other LEDs. 

   Indoor and outdoor LED panels   

There are two types of LED panels: conventional, using discrete LEDs, and   SMD    Surface Mounted Device  panels. Most outdoor screens and some indoor screens are built around discrete LEDs, also known as individually mounted LEDs. A cluster of red, green, and blue diodes is driven together to form a full-color pixel, usually square in shape. These pixels are spaced evenly apart and are measured from center to center for absolute pixel resolution.

Most indoor screens on the market are built using SMD technology   8212; a trend that is now extending to the outdoor market. An SMD pixel consists of red, green, and blue diodes mounted on a chipset, which is then mounted on the driver PC board. The individual diodes are smaller than a pin and are set very close together. The difference is that minimum viewing distance is reduced by 25  from the discrete diode screen with the same resolution.

Indoor use generally requires a screen that is based on SMD technology and has a minimum brightness of 600   candela   per   square metre    unofficially called              nits   . This will usually be more than sufficient for corporate and retail applications, but under high ambient-brightness conditions, you may need more punch to compete. Fashion and auto shows are two examples of high-brightness stage lighting that may require a higher LED brightness. Conversely, when your screen may be in a shot on a television show, the requirement will often be for lower brightness levels with lower color temperatures.

For outdoor use, you need at least 2,000 nits for most situations, whereas higher brightness types of up to 5,000 nits cope even better with direct sunlight on the screen. Until recently, only discrete diode screens could achieve that brightness level.  The brightness of LED panels also can be turned down. 

For specific projects, you need to take into account factors such as sight lines, local authority planning requirements  if the installation is to become semi-permanent , vehicular access  trucks carrying the screen, truck-mounted screens, or cranes , cable runs for power and video  accounting for both distance and health and safety requirements , power, suitability of the ground for the location of the screen  check to make sure there are no pipes, shallow drains, caves, or tunnels that may not be able to support heavy loads , and overhead obstructions.
