A '''light-emitting diode'''  '''LED'''  is a   semiconductor                 device   that                       emits light   when                    current   flows through it.   Electron  s in the semiconductor recombine with   electron hole  s, releasing energy in the form of   photon  s. The color of the light  corresponding to the energy of the photons  is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the   band gap   of the semiconductor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting   phosphor   on the semiconductor device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962, the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity   infrared    IR  light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Infrared LEDs are used in                  remote-control   circuits, such as those used with a wide variety of consumer electronics. The first visible-light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red.

Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps, replacing small                           incandescent bulbs  , and in   seven-segment display  s. Later developments produced LEDs available in                    visible  ,   ultraviolet    UV , and infrared wavelengths with high, low, or intermediate light output, for instance, white LEDs suitable for room and outdoor lighting. LEDs have also given rise to new types of displays and sensors, while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology with applications as diverse as                    aviation lighting  ,                    fairy lights  ,                   strip lights  ,                                                   automotive headlamps  , advertising,            general lighting  ,                 traffic signals  , camera flashes,                 lighted wallpaper  ,              horticultural grow lights  , and medical devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources, including lower power consumption, a longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller sizes, and faster switching. In exchange for these generally favorable attributes, disadvantages of LEDs include electrical limitations to low voltage and generally to DC  not AC  power, the inability to provide steady illumination from a pulsing DC or an AC electrical supply source, and a lesser maximum operating temperature and storage temperature.

LEDs are   transducer  s of electricity into light. They operate in reverse of   photodiode  s, which convert light into electricity.

  History  
  Main History of LEDs  

The first LED was created by Soviet inventor   Oleg Losev                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     in 1927, but   electroluminescence   was already known for 20 years, and relied on a diode made of   silicon carbide  .

Commercially viable LEDs only became available after   Texas Instruments   engineers patented efficient near-infrared emission from a diode based on                    GaAs   in 1962.

From 1968, commercial LEDs were extremely costly and saw no practical use.   Monsanto   and   Hewlett-Packard   led the development of LEDs to the point where, in the 1970s, a unit cost less than five cents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

   Physics of light production and emission   
  main Light-emitting diode physics  
In a light-emitting diode, the recombination of electrons and electron holes in a semiconductor produces light  be it infrared, visible or UV , a process called    electroluminescence   . The wavelength of the light depends on the energy   band gap   of the semiconductors used. Since these materials have a high index of refraction, design features of the devices such as special optical coatings and die shape are required to efficiently emit light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Unlike a   laser  , the light emitted from an LED is neither spectrally                       coherent   nor even highly   monochromatic  . Its                                     spectrum   is sufficiently narrow that it appears to the                human eye   as a pure                            saturated    color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Also unlike most lasers, its radiation is not                                         spatially coherent  , so it cannot approach the very high            intensity   characteristic of   laser  s.

By                                          selection of different semiconductor materials  , single-color LEDs can be made that emit light in a narrow band of wavelengths from near-infrared through the visible spectrum and into the ultraviolet range. The required operating voltages of LEDs increase as the emitted wavelengths become shorter  higher energy, red to blue , because of their increasing semiconductor band gap.
  anchor blue LED  

Blue LEDs have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN   quantum well  s sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative In Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber.

  Aluminium gallium nitride    AlGaN  of varying Al Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for   ultraviolet   LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN GaN blue green devices. If unalloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device emits near-ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365 nbsp;nm. Green LEDs manufactured from the InGaN GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non-nitride material systems, but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high-brightness applications.                                   

With                             AlGaN   and                                    AlGaInN  , even shorter wavelengths are achievable. Near-UV emitters at wavelengths around 360 395 nbsp;nm are already cheap and often encountered, for example, as   black light   lamp replacements for inspection of anti-  counterfeiting   UV watermarks in documents and bank notes, and for                  UV curing  . Substantially more expensive, shorter-wavelength diodes are commercially available for wavelengths down to 240 nbsp;nm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of   DNA  , with a peak at about 260 nbsp;nm, UV LED emitting at 250 270 nbsp;nm are expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices. Recent research has shown that commercially available UVA LEDs  365 nbsp;nm  are already effective disinfection and sterilization devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
UV-C wavelengths were obtained in laboratories using   aluminium nitride    210 nbsp;nm ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 boron nitride    215 nbsp;nm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and   diamond    235 nbsp;nm .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

   White LEDs   

There are two primary ways of producing   white   light-emitting diodes. One is to use individual LEDs that emit three   primary color  s red, green and blue and then mix all the colors to form white light. The other is to use a phosphor material to convert monochromatic light from a blue or UV LED to broad-spectrum white light, similar to a   fluorescent lamp  . The yellow phosphor is   cerium  -doped                            YAG   crystals suspended in the package or coated on the LED. This YAG phosphor causes white LEDs to appear yellow when off, and the space between the crystals allow some blue light to pass through in LEDs with partial phosphor conversion. Alternatively, white LEDs may use other phosphors like manganese IV -doped   potassium fluorosilicate    PFS  or other engineered phosphors. PFS assists in red light generation, and is used in conjunction with conventional Ce:YAG phosphor.

In LEDs with PFS phosphor, some blue light passes through the phosphors, the Ce:YAG phosphor converts blue light to green and red  yellow  light, and the PFS phosphor converts blue light to red light. The color, emission spectrum or color temperature of white phosphor converted and other phosphor converted LEDs can be controlled by changing the concentration of several phosphors that form a phosphor blend used in an LED package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

The 'whiteness' of the light produced is engineered to suit the human eye. Because of                      metamerism  , it is possible to have quite different spectra that appear white. The appearance of objects illuminated by that light may vary as the spectrum varies. This is the issue of color rendition, quite separate from color temperature. An orange or cyan object could appear with the wrong color and much darker as the LED or phosphor does not emit the wavelength it reflects. The best color rendition LEDs use a mix of phosphors, resulting in less efficiency and better color rendering.                                     

The first white light-emitting diodes  LEDs  were offered for sale in the autumn of 1996.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Nichia made some of the first white LEDs which were based on blue LEDs with Ce:YAG phosphor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ce:YAG is often grown using the   Czochralski method  .

Mixing red, green, and blue sources to produce white light needs electronic circuits to control the blending of the colors. Since LEDs have slightly different emission patterns, the color balance may change depending on the angle of view, even if the RGB sources are in a single package, so RGB diodes are seldom used to produce white lighting. Nonetheless, this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and in principle, this mechanism also has higher   quantum efficiency   in producing white light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

There are several types of multicolor white LEDs:                           di-  ,                tri-  , and   tetrachromatic   white LEDs. Several key factors that play among these different methods include color stability,                         color rendering   capability, and luminous efficacy. Often, higher efficiency means lower color rendering, presenting a trade-off between the luminous efficacy and color rendering. For example, the dichromatic white LEDs have the best luminous efficacy  120 lm W , but the lowest color rendering capability. Although tetrachromatic white LEDs have excellent color rendering capability, they often have poor luminous efficacy. Trichromatic white LEDs are in between, having both good luminous efficacy   70 lm W  and fair color rendering capability.                                                                                                                                              

One of the challenges is the development of more efficient green LEDs. The theoretical maximum for green LEDs is 683 lumens per watt but as of 2010 few green LEDs exceed even 100 lumens per watt. The blue and red LEDs approach their theoretical limits.                                     

Multicolor LEDs offer a means to form light of different colors. Most                    perceivable colors   can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors. This allows precise dynamic color control. Their emission power                     decays exponentially   with rising temperature,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
resulting in a substantial change in color stability. Such problems inhibit industrial use. Multicolor LEDs without phosphors cannot provide good color rendering because each LED is a narrowband source. LEDs without phosphor, while a poorer solution for general lighting, are the best solution for displays, either backlight of LCD, or direct LED based pixels.

Dimming a multicolor LED source to match the characteristics of incandescent lamps is difficult because manufacturing variations, age, and temperature change the actual color value output. To emulate the appearance of dimming incandescent lamps may require a feedback system with color sensor to actively monitor and control the color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

    Phosphor-based LEDs    
  File:White LED.png thumb upright 1.6 Spectrum of a white LED showing blue light directly emitted by the GaN-based LED  peak at about 465 nm  and the more broadband                Stokes-shifted   light emitted by the Ce sup 3   sup :YAG phosphor, which emits at roughly 500 700 nm  

This method involves   coating   LEDs of one color  mostly blue LEDs made of   InGaN    with   phosphor  s of different colors to form white light; the resultant LEDs are called phosphor-based or phosphor-converted white LEDs  pcLEDs .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A fraction of the blue light undergoes the Stokes shift, which transforms it from shorter wavelengths to longer. Depending on the original LED's color, various color phosphors are used. Using several phosphor layers of distinct colors broadens the emitted spectrum, effectively raising the                         color rendering index    CRI .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Phosphor-based LEDs have efficiency losses due to heat loss from the   Stokes shift   and also other phosphor-related issues. Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue  as modeled in the   luminosity function   .

Due to the simplicity of manufacturing, the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making high-intensity white LEDs. The design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex                RGB   system, and the majority of high-intensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.

Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10  Stokes shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10  to 30  of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.                                     

Some phosphor-based white LEDs encapsulate InGaN blue LEDs inside phosphor-coated epoxy. Alternatively, the LED might be paired with a remote phosphor, a preformed polycarbonate piece coated with the phosphor material. Remote phosphors provide more diffuse light, which is desirable for many applications. Remote phosphor designs are also more tolerant of variations in the LED emissions spectrum. A common yellow phosphor material is   cerium  -                          doped     yttrium aluminium garnet    Ce sup 3   sup :YAG .                                     

White LEDs can also be made by   coating   near-ultraviolet  NUV  LEDs with a mixture of high-efficiency   europium  -based phosphors that emit red and blue, plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide  ZnS:Cu, Al  that emits green. This is a method analogous to the way   fluorescent lamp  s work. This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG:Ce phosphor, as the Stokes shift is larger, so more energy is converted to heat, but yields light with better spectral characteristics, which render color better. Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones, both methods offer comparable brightness. A concern is that UV light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin.                                    

A new style of wafers composed of gallium-nitride-on-silicon  GaN-on-Si  is being used to produce white LEDs using 200-mm silicon wafers. This avoids the typical costly   sapphire                                   substrate   in relatively small 100- or 150-mm wafer sizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror-like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted. It was predicted that since 2020, 40  of all GaN LEDs are made with GaN-on-Si. Manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult, while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant. LED companies shifting from using sapphire to silicon should be a minimal investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

    Mixed white LEDs    
  File:Led Lights Panel.jpg thumb Tunable white LED array in a floodlight  
There are RGBW LEDs that combine RGB units with a phosphor white LED on the market. Doing so retains the extremely tunable color of RGB LED, but allows color rendering and efficiency to be optimized when a color close to white is selected.                                                                                                                                                                              

Some phosphor white LED units are  tunable white , blending two extremes of color temperatures  commonly 2700K and 6500K  to produce intermediate values. This feature allows users to change the lighting to suit the current use of a multifunction room.                                                                                                                                                                                            As illustrated by a straight line on the chromaticity diagram, simple two-white blends will have a pink bias, becoming most severe in the middle. A small amount of green light, provided by another LED, could correct the problem.                                                                                                                                                               Some products are RGBWW, i.e. RGBW with tunable white.                                                                                                                                                                                                    

A final class of white LED with mixed light is dim-to-warm. These are ordinary 2700K white LED bulbs with a small red LED that turns on when the bulb is dimmed. Doing so makes the color warmer, emulating an incandescent light bulb.                    

    Other white LEDs    
Another method used to produce experimental white light LEDs used no phosphors at all and was based on           homoepitaxially   grown   zinc selenide    ZnSe  on a ZnSe substrate that simultaneously emitted blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                          

  Organic light-emitting diodes  OLEDs   
  Main OLED  

In an organic light-emitting diode    OLED   , the                       electroluminescent   material composing the emissive layer of the diode is an   organic compound  . The organic material is electrically conductive due to the                        delocalization   of           pi electrons   caused by                     conjugation   over all or part of the molecule, and the material therefore functions as an   organic semiconductor  .

The potential advantages of OLEDs include thin, low-cost displays with a low driving voltage, wide viewing angle, and high contrast and color   gamut  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Polymer LEDs have the added benefit of printable and                                         flexible   displays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    OLEDs have been used to make visual displays for portable electronic devices such as cellphones, digital cameras, lighting and televisions.                                                    

  Types  
  File:Verschiedene LEDs.jpg thumb LEDs are produced in a variety of shapes and sizes. The color of the plastic lens is often the same as the actual color of light emitted, but not always. For instance, purple plastic is often used for infrared LEDs, and most blue devices have colorless housings. Modern high-power LEDs such as those used for lighting and backlighting are generally found in   surface-mount technology    SMT  packages  not shown . 397x397px

LEDs are made in different packages for different applications. A single or a few LED junctions may be packed in one miniature device for use as an indicator or pilot lamp. An LED array may include controlling circuits within the same package, which may range from a simple   resistor  , blinking or color changing control, or an addressable controller for RGB devices. Higher-powered white-emitting devices will be mounted on heat sinks and will be used for illumination. Alphanumeric displays in dot matrix or bar formats are widely available. Special packages permit connection of LEDs to optical fibers for high-speed data communication links.

These are mostly single-die LEDs used as indicators, and they come in various sizes from 1.8 nbsp;mm to 10 nbsp;mm,   through-hole   and   surface mount   packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Typical current ratings range from around 1 nbsp;mA to above 20 nbsp;mA. LED's can be soldered to a flexible PCB strip to form LED tape popularly used for decoration.

Common package shapes include round, with a domed or flat top, rectangular with a flat top  as used in bar-graph displays , and triangular or square with a flat top. The encapsulation may also be clear or tinted to improve contrast and viewing angle. Infrared devices may have a black tint to block visible light while passing infrared radiation, such as the Osram SFH 4546.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

5 nbsp;V and 12 nbsp;V LEDs are ordinary miniature LEDs that have a series resistor for direct connection to a 5  nbsp  V or 12  nbsp  V supply.

High-power LEDs  HP-LEDs  or high-output LEDs  HO-LEDs  can be driven at currents from hundreds of mA to more than an ampere, compared with the tens of mA for other LEDs. Some can emit over a thousand lumens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              LED                 power densities   up to 300 W cm sup 2  sup  have been achieved. Since overheating is destructive, the HP-LEDs must be mounted on a heat sink to allow for heat dissipation. If the heat from an HP-LED is not removed, the device fails in seconds. One HP-LED can often replace an incandescent bulb in a   flashlight  , or be set in an array to form a powerful   LED lamp  .

Some HP-LEDs in this category are the   Nichia   19 series,   Lumileds   Rebel Led, Osram Opto Semiconductors Golden Dragon, and Cree X-lamp. As of September 2009, some HP-LEDs manufactured by Cree exceed 105 nbsp;lm W.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Examples for   Haitz's law   which predicts an exponential rise in light output and efficacy of LEDs over time are the CREE XP-G series LED, which achieved 105  nbsp  lm W in 2009                              and the Nichia 19 series with a typical efficacy of 140  nbsp  lm W, released in 2010.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

   AC-driven   
LEDs developed by Seoul Semiconductor can operate on AC power without a DC converter. For each half-cycle, part of the LED emits light and part is dark, and this is reversed during the next half-cycle. The efficiency of this type of HP-LED is typically 40  nbsp  lm W.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A large number of LED elements in series may be able to operate directly from line voltage. In 2009, Seoul Semiconductor released a high DC voltage LED, named 'Acrich MJT', capable of being driven from AC power with a simple controlling circuit. The low-power dissipation of these LEDs affords them more flexibility than the original AC LED design.

; Flashing: Flashing LEDs are used as attention seeking indicators without requiring external electronics. Flashing LEDs resemble standard LEDs but they contain an integrated   voltage regulator   and a   multivibrator   circuit that causes the LED to flash with a typical period of one second. In diffused lens LEDs, this circuit is visible as a small black dot. Most flashing LEDs emit light of one color, but more sophisticated devices can flash between multiple colors and even fade through a color sequence using RGB color mixing. Flashing SMD LEDs in the 0805 and other size formats have been available since early 2019.
; Flickering: Integrated electronics Simple electronic circuits integrated into the LED package have been around since at least 2011 which produce a random LED intensity pattern reminiscent of a flickering   candle  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reverse engineering   in 2024 has suggested that some flickering LEDs with automatic sleep and wake modes might be using an integrated                   8-bit     microcontroller   for such functionally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
; Bi-color: Bi-color LEDs contain two different LED emitters in one case. There are two types of these. One type consists of two dies connected to the same two leads                              antiparallel   to each other. Current flow in one direction emits one color, and current in the opposite direction emits the other color. The other type consists of two dies with separate leads for both dies and another lead for common anode or cathode so that they can be controlled independently. The most common bi-color combination is                  red traditional green  . Others include amber traditional green, red pure green, red blue, and blue pure green.
; RGB tri-color: Tri-color LEDs contain three different LED emitters in one case. Each emitter is connected to a separate lead so they can be controlled independently. A four-lead arrangement is typical with one common lead  anode or cathode  and an additional lead for each color. Others have only two leads  positive and negative  and have a built-in electronic controller.                   RGB   LEDs consist of one red, one green, and one blue LED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        By independently                          adjusting   each of the three, RGB LEDs are capable of producing a wide color gamut. Unlike dedicated-color LEDs, these do not produce pure wavelengths. Modules may not be optimized for smooth color mixing.
; Decorative-multicolor: Decorative-multicolor LEDs incorporate several emitters of different colors supplied by only two lead-out wires. Colors are switched internally by varying the supply voltage.
; Alphanumeric: Alphanumeric LEDs are available in                         seven-segment  ,                     starburst  , and                      dot-matrix   format. Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5 7 pixels per character. Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of   liquid crystal display  s, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.
; Digital RGB: Digital RGB addressable LEDs contain their own  smart  control electronics. In addition to power and ground, these provide connections for data-in, data-out, clock and sometimes a strobe signal. These are connected in a                                        daisy chain  , which allows individual LEDs in a long   LED strip light   to be easily controlled by a microcontroller. Data sent to the first LED of the chain can control the brightness and color of each LED independently of the others. They are used where a combination of maximum control and minimum visible electronics are needed such as strings for Christmas and LED matrices. Some even have refresh rates in the kHz range, allowing for basic video applications. These devices are known by their part number   https:  cdn-shop.adafruit.com datasheets WS2812.pdf WS2812  being common  or a brand name such as                                NeoPixel  .
; Filament: An   LED filament   consists of multiple LED chips connected in series on a common longitudinal substrate that forms a thin rod reminiscent of a traditional incandescent filament.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        These are being used as a low-cost decorative alternative for traditional light bulbs that are being phased out in many countries. The filaments use a rather high voltage, allowing them to work efficiently with mains voltages. Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of the low voltage, high current converter that single die LEDs need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Usually, they are packaged in bulb similar to the lamps they were designed to replace, and filled with inert gas at slightly lower than ambient pressure to remove heat efficiently and prevent corrosion.
; Chip-on-board arrays: Surface-mounted LEDs are frequently produced in   chip on board    COB  arrays, allowing better heat dissipation than with a single LED of comparable luminous output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The LEDs can be arranged around a cylinder, and are called  corn cob lights  because of the rows of yellow LEDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

   Considerations for use   

  Efficiency: LEDs emit more lumens per watt than incandescent light bulbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The efficiency of LED lighting fixtures is not affected by shape and size, unlike fluorescent light bulbs or tubes.
  Size: LEDs can be very small  smaller than 2 nbsp;mm sup 2  sup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              and are easily attached to printed circuit boards.

    Power sources    
  Main LED power sources  
  File:LED circuit.svg thumb upright Simple LED circuit with resistor for current limiting  

The current in an LED or other diodes rises exponentially with the applied voltage  see   Shockley diode equation   , so a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current. Current through the LED must be regulated by an external circuit such as a   constant current   source to prevent damage. Since most common power supplies are  nearly  constant-voltage sources, LED fixtures must include a power converter, or at least a current-limiting resistor. In some applications, the internal resistance of small batteries is sufficient to keep current within the LED rating.                                     

LEDs are sensitive to voltage. They must be supplied with a voltage above their                             threshold voltage   and a current below their rating. Current and lifetime change greatly with a small change in applied voltage. They thus require a current-regulated supply  usually just a series resistor for indicator LEDs .                                                                                   

            Efficiency droop  : The efficiency of LEDs decreases as the   electric current   increases. Heating also increases with higher currents, which compromises LED lifetime. These effects put practical limits on the current through an LED in high power applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

    Electrical polarity    
  Main Electrical polarity of LEDs  

Unlike a traditional incandescent lamp, an LED will light only when voltage is applied in the forward direction of the diode. No current flows and no light is emitted if voltage is applied in the reverse direction. If the reverse voltage exceeds the   breakdown voltage  , which is typically about five volts, a large current flows and the LED will be damaged. If the reverse current is sufficiently limited to avoid damage, the reverse-conducting LED is a useful                                    noise diode  .                                     

By definition, the energy band gap of any diode is higher when reverse-biased than when forward-biased. Because the band gap energy determines the wavelength of the light emitted, the color cannot be the same when reverse-biased. The reverse breakdown voltage is sufficiently high that the emitted wavelength cannot be similar enough to still be visible. Though dual-LED packages exist that contain a different color LED in each direction, it is not expected that any single LED element can emit visible light when reverse-biased.                                      

It is not known if any zener diode could exist that emits light only in reverse-bias mode. Uniquely, this type of LED would conduct when connected backwards.

   Appearance   
  Color: LEDs can emit light of an intended color without using any color filters as traditional lighting methods need. This is more efficient and can lower initial costs.
  Cool light: In contrast to most light sources, LEDs radiate very little heat in the form of IR that can cause damage to sensitive objects or fabrics. Wasted energy is dispersed as heat through the base of the LED.
  Color rendition: Most cool-                    white LEDs   have spectra that differ significantly from a   black body   radiator like the sun or an incandescent light. The spike at 460 nbsp;nm and dip at 500 nbsp;nm can make the color of objects                appear differently   under cool-white LED illumination than sunlight or incandescent sources, due to                      metamerism  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               red surfaces being rendered particularly poorly by typical phosphor-based cool-white LEDs. The same is true with green surfaces. The quality of color rendition of an LED is measured by the                         Color Rendering Index  CRI   .
  Dimming: LEDs can be          dimmed   either by   pulse-width modulation   or lowering the forward current.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This pulse-width modulation is why LED lights, particularly headlights on cars, when viewed on camera or by some people, seem to flash or flicker. This is a type of   stroboscopic effect  .

   Light properties   
  Switch on time: LEDs light up extremely quickly. A typical red indicator LED achieves full brightness in under a   microsecond  .                                                                                                                                                                                               LEDs used in communications devices can have even faster response times.
  Focus: The solid package of the LED can be designed to                  focus   its light. Incandescent and fluorescent sources often require an external reflector to collect light and direct it in a usable manner. For larger LED packages   total internal reflection    TIR  lenses are often used to the same effect. When large quantities of light are needed, many light sources such as LED chips are usually deployed, which are difficult to focus or   collimate   on the same target.
  Area light source: Single LEDs do not approximate a   point source   of light giving a spherical light distribution, but rather a                        lambertian   distribution. So, LEDs are difficult to apply to uses needing a spherical light field. Different fields of light can be manipulated by the application of different optics or  lenses . LEDs cannot provide divergence below a few degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

   Reliability   
  Shock resistance: LEDs, being solid-state components, are difficult to damage with external shock, unlike fluorescent and incandescent bulbs, which are fragile.                                                                                                                                                                                         
  Thermal runaway: Parallel strings of LEDs will not share current evenly due to the manufacturing tolerances in their forward voltage. Running two or more strings from a single current source may result in LED failure as the devices warm up. If forward voltage binning is not possible, a circuit is required to ensure even distribution of current between parallel strands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  Slow failure: LEDs mainly fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt failure of incandescent bulbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  Lifetime: LEDs can have a relatively long useful life. One report estimates 35,000 to 50,000 hours of useful life, though time to complete failure may be shorter or longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Fluorescent tubes typically are rated at about 10,000 to 25,000 hours, depending partly on the conditions of use, and incandescent light bulbs at 1,000 to 2,000 hours. Several                                      DOE   demonstrations have shown that reduced maintenance costs from this extended lifetime, rather than energy savings, is the primary factor in determining the payback period for an LED product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  Cycling: LEDs are ideal for uses subject to frequent on-off cycling, unlike incandescent and fluorescent lamps that fail faster when cycled often, or   high-intensity discharge lamp  s  HID lamps  that require a long time to warm up to full output and to cool down before they can be lighted again if they are being restarted.
  Temperature dependence: LED performance largely depends on the ambient temperature of the operating environment nbsp;  or thermal management properties. Overdriving an LED in high ambient temperatures may result in overheating the LED package, eventually leading to device failure. An adequate   heat sink   is needed to maintain long life. This is especially important in automotive, medical, and military uses where devices must operate over a wide range of temperatures, and require low failure rates.

   Manufacturing   
LED manufacturing involves multiple steps, including epitaxy, chip processing, chip separation, and packaging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

In a typical LED manufacturing process, encapsulation is performed after probing, dicing, die transfer from wafer to package, and wire bonding or flip chip mounting,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        perhaps using   indium tin oxide  , a transparent electrical conductor. In this case, the bond wire s  are attached to the ITO film that has been deposited in the LEDs.

Flip chip circuit on board  COB  is a technique that can be used to manufacture LEDs.

   Applications   
  File:LED DaytimeRunningLights.jpg thumb   Daytime running light   LEDs of an automobile  

LED uses fall into five major categories:

  Visual signals where light goes more or less directly from the source to the human eye, to convey a message or meaning
             Illumination   where light is reflected from objects to give visual response of these objects
  Measuring and interacting with processes involving no human vision                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Narrow band light sensors where                         LEDs operate in a reverse-bias mode   and respond to incident light, instead of emitting light

The application of LEDs in horticulture has revolutionized plant cultivation by providing energy-efficient, customizable lighting solutions that optimize plant growth and development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             LEDs offer precise control over light spectra, intensity, and photoperiods, enabling growers to tailor lighting conditions to the specific needs of different plant species and growth stages. This technology enhances photosynthesis, improves crop yields, and reduces energy costs compared to traditional lighting systems. Additionally, LEDs generate less heat, allowing closer placement to plants without risking thermal damage, and contribute to sustainable farming practices by lowering carbon footprints and extending growing seasons in controlled environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Light spectrum affects growth, metabolite profile, and resistance against fungal phytopathogens of ''         Solanum lycopersicum  '' seedlings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                LEDs can also be used in   micropropagation  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

   Indicators and signs

The                       low energy consumption  , low maintenance and small size of LEDs has led to uses as status indicators and displays on a variety of equipment and installations. Large-area   LED display  s are used as stadium displays, dynamic decorative displays, and   dynamic message sign  s on freeways. Thin, lightweight message displays are used at airports and railway stations, and as                    destination displays   for trains, buses, trams, and ferries.

One-color light is well suited for   traffic light  s and signals,   exit sign  s,   emergency vehicle lighting  , ships' navigation lights, and                                      LED-based Christmas lights  

Because of their long life, fast switching times, and visibility in broad daylight due to their high output and focus, LEDs have been used in automotive brake lights and turn signals. The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, about 0.1 second faster                                    than an incandescent bulb. This gives drivers behind more time to react. In a dual intensity circuit  rear markers and brakes  if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a                                             phantom array  , where ghost images of the LED appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array. White LED headlamps are beginning to appear. Using LEDs has styling advantages because LEDs can form much thinner lights than incandescent lamps with   parabolic reflector  s.

Due to the relative cheapness of low output LEDs, they are also used in many temporary uses such as   glowstick  s and throwies. Artists have also used LEDs for   LED art  .

   Lighting   
  main LED lamp  
With the development of high-efficiency and high-power LEDs, it has become possible to use LEDs in lighting and illumination. To encourage the shift to   LED lamp  s and other high-efficiency lighting, in 2008 the   US Department of Energy   created the   L Prize   competition. The   Philips   Lighting North America LED bulb won the first competition on August 3, 2011, after successfully completing 18 months of intensive field, lab, and product testing.                                                                                                                                                                        

Efficient lighting is needed for   sustainable architecture  . As of 2011, some LED bulbs provide up to 150 nbsp;lm W and even inexpensive low-end models typically exceed 50 nbsp;lm W, so that a 6-watt LED could achieve the same results as a standard 40-watt incandescent bulb. The lower heat output of LEDs also reduces demand on   air conditioning   systems. Worldwide, LEDs are rapidly adopted to displace less effective sources such as                           incandescent lamps   and                            CFLs   and reduce electrical energy consumption and its associated emissions. Solar powered LEDs are used as   street light  s and in                                 architectural lighting  .

The mechanical robustness and long lifetime are used in   automotive lighting   on cars, motorcycles, and                         bicycle lights  .   LED street light  s are employed on poles and in parking garages. In 2007, the Italian village of   Torraca   was the first place to convert its street lighting to LEDs.                                                                                                                                        

Cabin lighting on recent  when date October 2022     Airbus   and   Boeing   jetliners uses LED lighting. LEDs are also being used in airport and heliport lighting. LED airport fixtures currently include medium-intensity runway lights, runway centerline lights, taxiway centerline and edge lights, guidance signs, and obstruction lighting.

LEDs are also used as a light source for                            DLP   projectors, and to   backlight   newer                          LCD   television  referred to as                           LED TV   , computer monitor  including   laptop    and handheld device LCDs, succeeding older   CCFL  -backlit LCDs although being superseded by   OLED   screens. RGB LEDs raise the color gamut by as much as 45 . Screens for TV and computer displays can be made thinner using LEDs for backlighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

LEDs are small, durable and need little power, so they are used in handheld devices such as   flashlight  s. LED   strobe light  s or   camera flash  es operate at a safe, low voltage, instead of the 250  volts commonly found in   xenon   flashlamp-based lighting. This is especially useful in cameras on   mobile phone  s, where space is at a premium and bulky voltage-raising circuitry is undesirable.

LEDs are used for infrared illumination in   night vision   uses including   security camera  s. A ring of LEDs around a   video camera  , aimed forward into a   retroreflective                       background  , allows   chroma keying   in   video production  s.

LEDs are used in   mining   operations, as   cap lamp  s to provide light for miners. Research has been done to improve LEDs for mining, to reduce glare and to increase illumination, reducing risk of injury to the miners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

LEDs are increasingly finding uses in medical and educational applications, for example as mood enhancement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            NASA   has even sponsored research for the use of LEDs to promote health for astronauts.

Light can be used to transmit data and analog signals. For example, lighting white LEDs can be used in systems assisting people to navigate in closed spaces while searching necessary rooms or objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

  Assistive listening device  s in many theaters and similar spaces use arrays of infrared LEDs to send sound to listeners' receivers. Light-emitting diodes  as well as semiconductor lasers  are used to send data over many types of                 fiber optic   cable, from digital audio over   TOSLINK   cables to the very high bandwidth fiber links that form the Internet backbone. For some time, computers were commonly equipped with   IrDA   interfaces, which allowed them to send and receive data to nearby machines via infrared.

Because LEDs can             cycle on and off   millions of times per second, very high data bandwidth can be achieved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  For that reason,   visible light communication    VLC  has been proposed as an alternative to the increasingly competitive radio bandwidth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      VLC operates in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, so data can be transmitted without occupying the frequencies of radio communications.

    Machine vision systems    
  main Machine vision  
  Machine vision   systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination, so features of interest are easier to process. LEDs are often used.

  Barcode scanner  s are the most common example of machine vision applications, and many of those scanners use red LEDs instead of lasers. Optical computer mice use LEDs as a light source for the miniature camera within the mouse.

LEDs are useful for machine vision because they provide a compact, reliable source of light. LED lamps can be turned on and off to suit the needs of the vision system, and the shape of the beam produced can be tailored to match the system's requirements.

    Biological detection    
The discovery of radiative recombination in aluminum gallium nitride  AlGaN  alloys by                                          U.S. Army Research Laboratory    ARL  led to the conceptualization of UV light-emitting diodes  LEDs  to be incorporated in light-induced   fluorescence   sensors used for biological agent detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In 2004, the                                       Edgewood Chemical Biological Center  ECBC    initiated the effort to create a biological detector named TAC-BIO. The program capitalized on semiconductor UV optical sources  SUVOS  developed by the         Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA   .                 

UV-induced fluorescence is one of the most robust techniques used for rapid real-time detection of biological aerosols.                  The first UV sensors were lasers lacking in-field-use practicality. In order to address this, DARPA incorporated SUVOS technology to create a low-cost, small, lightweight, low-power device. The TAC-BIO detector's response time was one minute from when it sensed a biological agent. It was also demonstrated that the detector could be operated unattended indoors and outdoors for weeks at a time.                 

Aerosolized biological particles fluoresce and scatter light under a UV light beam. Observed fluorescence is dependent on the applied wavelength and the biochemical fluorophores within the biological agent. UV induced fluorescence offers a rapid, accurate, efficient and logistically practical way for biological agent detection. This is because the use of UV fluorescence is reagentless, or a process that does not require an added chemical to produce a reaction, with no consumables, or produces no chemical byproducts.                 

Additionally, TAC-BIO can reliably discriminate between threat and non-threat aerosols. It was claimed to be sensitive enough to detect low concentrations, but not so sensitive that it would cause false positives. The particle-counting algorithm used in the device converted raw data into information by counting the photon pulses per unit of time from the fluorescence and scattering detectors, and comparing the value to a set threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

The original TAC-BIO was introduced in 2010, while the second-generation TAC-BIO GEN nbsp;II, was designed in 2015 to be more cost-efficient, as plastic parts were used. Its small, light-weight design allows it to be mounted to vehicles, robots, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The second-generation device could also be utilized as an environmental detector to monitor air quality in hospitals, airplanes, or even in households to detect fungus and mold.

The light from LEDs can be modulated very quickly so they are used extensively in   optical fiber   and   free space optics   communications. This includes   remote control  s, such as for television sets, where infrared LEDs are often used.   Opto-isolator  s use an LED combined with a   photodiode   or   phototransistor   to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits. This is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low-voltage   sensor   circuit  usually battery-powered  in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages. An optoisolator also lets information be transferred between circuits that do not share a common ground potential.

Many sensor systems rely on light as the signal source. LEDs are often ideal as a light source due to the requirements of the sensors. The Nintendo   Wii  's sensor bar uses infrared LEDs.   Pulse oximeter  s use them for measuring   oxygen saturation  . Some flatbed scanners use arrays of RGB LEDs rather than the typical   cold-cathode fluorescent lamp   as the light source. Having independent control of three illuminated colors allows the scanner to calibrate itself for more accurate color balance, and there is no need for warm-up. Further, its sensors only need be monochromatic, since at any one time the page being scanned is only lit by one color of light.

Since LEDs can also be used as photodiodes, they can be used for both photo emission and detection. This could be used, for example, in a   touchscreen   that registers reflected light from a finger or   stylus  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Many materials and biological systems are sensitive to, or dependent on, light.   Grow lights   use LEDs to increase   photosynthesis   in   plant  s,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          and bacteria and viruses can be removed from water and other substances using UV LEDs for                                sterilization  .                                   LEDs of certain wavelengths have also been used for   light therapy   treatment of   neonatal jaundice   and   acne  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

UV LEDs, with spectra range of 220 nbsp;nm to 395 nbsp;nm, have other applications, such as                      water                      air   purification, surface disinfection, glue curing, free-space   non-line-of-sight communication  , high performance liquid chromatography, UV curing dye printing,   phototherapy    295nm   Vitamin D  , 308nm   Excimer lamp   or laser replacement , medical  analytical instrumentation, and DNA absorption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

LEDs have also been used as a medium-quality   voltage reference   in electronic circuits. The forward voltage drop  about 1.7 nbsp;V for a red LED or 1.2V for an infrared  can be used instead of a   Zener diode   in low-voltage regulators. Red LEDs have the flattest I V curve above the knee. Nitride-based LEDs have a fairly steep I V curve and are useless for this purpose. Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3 nbsp;V are not widely available.

The progressive miniaturization of low-voltage lighting technology, such as LEDs and OLEDs, suitable to incorporate into low-thickness materials has fostered experimentation in combining light sources and wall covering surfaces for interior walls in the form of   LED wallpaper  .

   Research and development   
    Key challenges    
LEDs require optimized efficiency to hinge on ongoing improvements such as phosphor materials and   quantum dot  s.                                                                                                                                                          

The process of down-conversion  the method by which materials convert more-energetic photons to different, less energetic colors  also needs improvement. For example, the red phosphors that are used today are thermally sensitive and need to be improved in that aspect so that they do not color shift and experience efficiency drop-off with temperature. Red phosphors could also benefit from a narrower spectral width to emit more lumens and becoming more efficient at converting photons.                                                                                                                                                           

In addition, work remains to be done in the realms of current efficiency droop, color shift, system reliability, light distribution, dimming, thermal management, and power supply performance.                 

Early suspicions were that the LED droop was caused by elevated temperatures. Scientists showed that temperature was not the root cause of efficiency droop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The mechanism causing efficiency droop was identified in 2007 as                                                            Auger recombination  , which was taken with mixed reaction.                        A 2013 study conclusively identified Auger recombination as the cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

    Potential technology    

A new family of LEDs are based on the semiconductors called                          perovskites  . In 2018, less than four years after their discovery, the ability of perovskite LEDs  PLEDs  to produce light from electrons already rivaled those of the best performing   OLED  s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   They have a potential for cost-effectiveness as they can be processed from solution, a low-cost and low-tech method, which might allow perovskite-based devices that have large areas to be made with extremely low cost. Their efficiency is superior by eliminating non-radiative losses, in other words, elimination of                                        recombination   pathways that do not produce photons; or by solving outcoupling problem  prevalent for thin-film LEDs  or balancing charge carrier injection to increase the                               EQE    external quantum efficiency . The most up-to-date PLED devices have broken the performance barrier by shooting the EQE above 20 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

In 2018, Cao et al. and Lin et al. independently published two papers on developing perovskite LEDs with EQE greater than 20 , which made these two papers a mile-stone in PLED development. Their device have similar planar structure, i.e. the active layer  perovskite  is sandwiched between two electrodes. To achieve a high EQE, they not only reduced non-radiative recombination, but also utilized their own, subtly different methods to improve the EQE.                 

In the work of Cao ''et al.'',                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          researchers targeted the outcoupling problem, which is that the optical physics of thin-film LEDs causes the majority of light generated by the semiconductor to be trapped in the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To achieve this goal, they demonstrated that solution-processed perovskites can spontaneously form submicrometre-scale crystal platelets, which can efficiently extract light from the device. These perovskites are formed via the introduction of   amino acid   additives into the perovskite                         precursor   solutions. In addition, their method is able to passivate perovskite surface                                       defects   and reduce nonradiative recombination. Therefore, by improving the light outcoupling and reducing nonradiative losses, Cao and his colleagues successfully achieved PLED with EQE up to 20.7 .                        

Lin and his colleague used a different approach to generate high EQE. Instead of modifying the microstructure of perovskite layer, they chose to adopt a new strategy for managing the compositional distribution in the device an approach that simultaneously provides high   luminescence   and balanced charge injection. In other words, they still used flat emissive layer, but tried to optimize the balance of electrons and holes injected into the perovskite, so as to make the most efficient use of the charge carriers. Moreover, in the perovskite layer, the crystals are perfectly enclosed by MABr additive  where MA is CH sub 3  sub NH sub 3  sub  . The MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects that would otherwise be present perovskite crystals, resulting in reduction of the nonradiative recombination. Therefore, by balancing charge injection and decreasing nonradiative losses, Lin and his colleagues developed PLED with EQE up to 20.3 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

   Health and safety   

Certain blue LEDs and cool-white LEDs can exceed safe limits of the so-called   blue-light hazard   as defined in eye safety specifications such as  ANSI IESNA RP-27.1 05: Recommended Practice for Photobiological Safety for Lamp and Lamp Systems .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      One study showed no evidence of a risk in normal use at domestic illuminance,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               and that caution is only needed for particular occupational situations or for specific populations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In 2006, the   International Electrotechnical Commission   published ''IEC 62471 Photobiological safety of lamps and lamp systems'', replacing the application of early laser-oriented standards for classification of LED sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

While LEDs have the advantage over   fluorescent lamp  s, in that they do not contain                     mercury  , they may contain other hazardous metals such as   lead   and   arsenic  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

In 2016 the   American Medical Association    AMA  issued a statement concerning the possible adverse influence of blueish   street light  ing on the   sleep-wake cycle   of city-dwellers. Critics in the industry claim exposure levels are not high enough to have a noticeable effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

   Environmental issues   

    Light pollution  : Because          white LEDs   emit more short wavelength light than sources such as high-pressure   sodium vapor lamp  s, the increased blue and green sensitivity of   scotopic vision   means that white LEDs used in outdoor lighting cause substantially more   sky glow  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  Impact on wildlife: LEDs are much more attractive to insects than sodium-vapor lights, so much so that there has been speculative concern about the possibility of disruption to   food web  s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            LED lighting near beaches, particularly intense blue and white colors, can disorient turtle hatchlings and make them wander inland instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The use of  turtle-safe lighting  LEDs that emit only at narrow portions of the visible spectrum is encouraged by conservancy groups in order to reduce harm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Use in winter conditions: Since they do not give off much heat in comparison to incandescent lights, LED lights used for traffic control can have snow obscuring them, leading to accidents.
