'''Insulin'''    Latin   ''insula'',  island , as it is produced in the   Islets of Langerhans    is a   polypeptide                     hormone   that regulates   carbohydrate metabolism  . Apart from being the primary effector in carbohydrate homeostasis, it also takes part in the metabolism of         fat      triglyceride  s  and   protein  s  ndash; it has   anabolic   properties. It also affects other tissues.

Insulin is used medically in some forms of   diabetes mellitus  . Patients with                            Type 1 diabetes mellitus   depend on exogenous insulin  injected subcutaneously  for their survival because of an absolute deficiency of the hormone; patients with                            Type 2 diabetes mellitus   have either relatively low insulin production or   insulin resistance  , and occasionally require insulin administration if other medications are inadequate in controlling blood glucose levels.

Insulin has the empirical formula          C   sub 254  sub            H   sub 377  sub            N   sub 65  sub          O   sub 75  sub          S   sub 6  sub . 

  Discovery and characterization   
In 1869   Paul Langerhans  , a medical student in   Berlin  , was studying the structure of the pancreas under a new   microscope   when he noticed some previously unidentified cells scattered in the exocrine tissue. The function of the  little heaps of cells , later          known as   the ''Islets of Langerhans'', was unknown, but   Edouard Laguesse   later argued that they may produce a secretion that plays a regulatory role in digestion.

In 1889, the           German   physician   Oscar Minkowski   removed the   pancreas   from a healthy dog to demonstrate this assumed role in digestion. Several days after the dog's pancreas was removed,   Bernardo Houssay  , Minkowski's animal keeper, noticed a swarm of flies feeding on the dog's urine. On testing the urine they found that the dog was secreting sugar in its urine, demonstrating for the first time the relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901 another major step was taken by   Eugene Opie  , when he clearly identified that ''Diabetes mellitus.... is caused by destruction of the islands of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed.'' Before this demonstration the link between the pancreas and diabetes was clear, but not the specific nature of the islets.

Over the next two decades several attempts were made to isolate the secretion of the islets as a potential treatment. In 1906   Georg Ludwig Zuelzer   was partially successful treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912   E.L. Scott   at the   University of Chicago   used aqueous pancreatic extracts and noted ''a slight diminution of glycosuria'', but was unable to convince his director and the research was shut down.   Israel Kleiner   demonstrated similar effects at   Rockefeller University   in 1919, but his work was interrupted by   World War I   and he was unable to return to it.   Nicolae Paulescu  , a professor of physiology at the   Romanian School of Medicine   published similar work in 1921 that was carried out in   France  , and it has been argued ever since by Romanians that he is the rightful discoverer.

However the practical extraction of insulin is credited to a team at the   University of Toronto  . In October 1920   Frederick Banting   was reading one of Minkowski's papers and concluded that it was the very digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied that were breaking down the secretion, thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. He jotted a note to himself ''Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets. Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosurea.''

He travelled to Toronto to meet with                              J.J.R. Macleod  , who was not entirely impressed with his idea. Nevertheless he supplied Banting with a lab at the University, an assistant,   Charles Best  , and ten dogs, while he left on vacation during the summer of 1921. Using his idea, Banting and Best were able to keep a pancretized dog alive all summer. Their method worked by tying a ligature  string  around the pancreatic duct, and when examined several weeks later the pancreatic digestive cells had died and been absorbed by the immune system, leaving thousands of islets. They then isolated the protein from these islets to produce what they called ''isletin''.

Macleod saw the value of the research on his return from Europe, but demanded a re-run to prove the method actually worked. Several weeks later it was clear the second run was also a success, and he helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. However they needed six weeks to extract the isletin, dramatically slowing testing. Banting suggested they try to use fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands, and was relieved to find this method worked well. With the supply problem solved, the next major effort was to purify the protein. In December 1921 Macleod invited the brilliant   biochemist  ,   James Collip  , to help with this task, and within a month he felt ready to test.

On   January 11  ,   1922  ,   Leonard Thompson  , a fourteen year old diabetic was given the first injection of insulin. Unfortunately the extract was so impure that he suffered a severe               allergic reaction   and further injections were cancelled. Over the next 12 days Collip worked day and night to improve the extract, and a second dose injected on the 23rd. This was completely successful, not only in not having obvious side-effects, but in completely eliminating the symptoms of diabetes. However Banting and Best never worked well with Collip, apparently seeing him as something of an interloper, and Collip left soon after.

Over the spring of 1922 Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the extract remained impure. However they had been approached by   Eli Lilly   with an offer of help shortly after their first publications in 1921, and they took them up on their offer in April. In November Lily made a major breakthrough, and were able to produce large quantities of very pure insulin. Insulin was offered for sale shortly thereafter.

For this breakthrough discovery, Macleod and Banting were awarded the   Nobel Prize   in   Physiology   or   Medicine   in   1923  . Banting, apparently insulted that Best was not mentioned, shared half of his price with Best, and MacLeod immediately shared some of his with Collip.

The exact sequence of   amino acid  s comprising the insulin molecule, the so-called   primary structure  , was determined by British molecular biologist   Frederick Sanger  . It was the first protein the structure of which was completely determined.  For this he was awarded the   Nobel Prize in Chemistry   in 1958. In 1967, after decades of work,   Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin   determined the spatial conformation of the molecule, by means of   X-ray diffraction   studies. She also was awarded a Nobel Prize.

  Structure and production  
Insulin is synthesized in humans and other mammals within the   beta cell  s  B-cells  of the   islets of Langerhans   in the pancreas. One to three million islets of Langerhans  pancreatic islets  form the   endocrine   part of the   pancreas  , which is primarily an   exocrine     gland  . The endocrine part accounts for only 2  of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the islets of Langerhans, beta cells constitute 60 ndash;80  of all the cells.

Insulin is built from 51 amino acids and is one of the smallest proteins known; shorter  proteins  are usually referred to as a   polypeptide  . Beef insulin differs from human insulin in two   amino acid   residues, and pork insulin in one residue. Fish insulin is also close enough to human insulin to be effective. In humans, insulin has a   molecular weight   of 5734. Insulin is structured as 2 polypeptide chains linked by 2   sulfur bridges    see figure shown above . Chain A consists of 21, and chain B of 30 amino acids. Insulin is produced as a   prohormone   molecule  ndash;   proinsulin    ndash; that is later transformed by               proteolytic   action into the active hormone.

The remaining part is called   C-peptide  . This polypeptide is released into the blood in equal amounts to the insulin protein. Since external insulins currently contain no C-peptide component, serum amounts of peptide C are good indicators of internal insulin production. C-peptide has recently been discovered to have biological activity itself; the activity is apparently confined to an effect on the muscular layer of the          arteries  .

  Actions on cellular and metabolic level  
The actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include:
  cellular intake of certain substances, most prominently   glucose  
  increase of   DNA replication   and   protein synthesis  
  modification of the activity of numerous   enzymes                allosteric effect   

The actions of insulin on cells include:
  increased   glycogen   synthesis  ndash; insulin forces storage of glucose in liver  and muscle  cells in the form of glycogen; lowered levels of insulin cause liver cells to convert glycogen to glucose and dump it into the blood. This is the clinical action of insulin which is useful in treating reducing high blood glucose levels in diabetes.
  increased   fatty acid   synthesis  ndash; insulin forces fat cells to take in glucose which is converted to fatty acids; lack of insulin causes the reverse 
  increased esterification of fatty acids  ndash; forces   adipose tissue   to make fats  ie, triglycerides  from fatty acid esters; lack of insulin causes the reverse
  decreased   proteinolysis    ndash; forces reduction of protein degradation; lack of insulin increases protein degradation, 
  decreased   lipolysis    ndash; forces reduction in conversion of fat cell lipid stores into blood fatty acids; lack of insulin causes the reverse
  decreased   gluconeogenesis    ndash; decreases production of glucose from various substrates in liver; lack of insulin causes glucose production from assorted substrates in the liver and elsewhere
  increased amino acid uptake  ndash; forces cells to absorb circulating amino acids; lack of insulin inhibits absorption
  increased potassium uptake  ndash; forces cells to absorb serum potassium; lack of insulin inhibits absorption 
  arterial muscle tone  ndash; forces arterial wall muscle to relax increasing blood flow, especially in micro arteries; lack of insulin reduces flow by allowing these muscles to contract

  Regulatory action on blood glucose  
Despite long intervals between meals or the occasional consumption of meals with a substantial   carbohydrate   load  e.g., half a   birthday cake   or a bag of potato chips , human   blood glucose   levels normally remain within a narrow range. In most humans this varies from about 70 mg dl to perhaps 110 mg dl  3.9 to 6.1   mmol   litre  except shortly after eating when the blood glucose level rises temporarily. In a healthy adult male of 75   kg   with a   blood   volume of 5   litre  , a blood glucose level of 100 mg dl or 5.5 mmol l corresponds to about 5 g  1 5 ounce  of glucose in the blood and approximately 45 g  1 1 2 ounces  in the total   body water    which obviously includes more than merely blood and will be usually about 60  of the total   body weight   in men . This               homeostatic   effect is the result of many factors, of which hormone regulation is the most important.

There are two groups of mutually antagonistic hormones affecting blood glucose levels:
  hyperglycemic hormones  such as   glucagon  ,   growth hormone  , and   adrenaline   , which increase blood glucose
  and one hypoglycemic hormone  insulin , which decreases blood glucose

Mechanisms which restore satisfactory blood glucose levels after   hypoglycemia   must be quick and effective because of the immediate serious consequences of insufficient glucose. This is because, at least in the short term, it is far more dangerous to have too little glucose in the blood than too much. In healthy individuals these mechanisms are indeed generally efficient, and symptomatic hypoglycemia is found almost entirely in diabetics using insulin or other pharmacologic treatment. Such hypoglycemic episodes vary greatly between persons and from time to time, both in severity and swiftness of onset. In severe cases prompt medical assistance is essential, as damage  to brain and other tissues  and even death will result from sufficiently low blood glucose levels.

  Image:Glucose-insulin-release.png right thumb 400px Mechanism of glucose dependent insulin release  
Beta cells in the islets of Langerhans are sensitive to variations in blood glucose levels through the following mechanism  see figure to the right :

  Glucose enters the   beta cell  s through the   glucose transporter     GLUT2  
  Glucose goes into the   glycolysis   and the   respiratory cycle   where the high-energy   ATP   molecule is produced by oxidation
  Dependent on blood glucose levels and hence ATP levels, the ATP controlled   potassium   channels  K   close and the cell membranes  depolarise
  On   depolarisation  , voltage controlled   calcium   channels  Ca2   open and calcium flows into the cells
  An increased calcium level in the cells causes release of previously synthetised insulin, which has been stored in   secretory     vesicles  
  The calcium level also regulates                   expression   of the insulin   gene   via the calcium responsive element binding protein    CREB   .

This is the main mechanism for release of insulin and regulation of insulin synthesis. In addition some insulin synthesis and release takes place generally at food intake, not just glucose or   carbohydrate   intake, and the beta cells are also somewhat influenced by the   autonomous nervous system  .

When the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value, insulin release from the beta cells slows or stops. If blood glucose levels drop lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones  most prominently glucagon from Islet alpha cells  forces release of glucose into the blood from cellular stores. The release of insulin is strongly inhibited by the   stress hormone     adrenalin    epinephrine .

  Signal transduction  
There are special transport channels in   cell membrane  s through which   glucose   from the blood can enter a cell. These channels are, indirectly, under insulin control in certain body cell types. A lack of circulating insulin will prevent glucose from entering those cells  eg, in untreated Type 1 diabetes .  However, more commonly there is a decrease in the sensitivity of cells to insulin  eg, the reduced insulin sensitivity characteristic of Type 2 diabetes , resulting in decreased glucose absorption. In either case, there is 'cell starvation', weight loss, sometimes extreme. In a few cases, there is a defect in the release of insulin from the pancreas. Either way, the effect is the same: elevated blood glucose levels.

Activation of   insulin receptor  s leads to internal cellular mechanisms which directly affect glucose uptake by regulating the number and operation of protein molecules in the cell membrane which transport glucose into the cell.

Two types of tissues are most strongly influenced by insulin as far as the stimulation of glucose uptake is concerned: muscle cells            myocytes    and fat cells              adipocytes   . The former are important because of their central role in movement, breathing, circulation, etc, and the latter because they accumulate excess calories against future needs. Together, they account for about 2 3 of all cells in a typical human body.

  The brain and hypoglycemia  
Though other cells can use other fuels for a while  most prominently fatty acids ,   neurons   are dependent on glucose as a source of energy in the non-starving human. They do not require insulin to absorb glucose, unlike muscle and adipose tissue and they have very small internal stores of glycogen. Thus, a sufficiently low glucose level first and most dramatically manifests itself in impaired functioning of the   central nervous system    ndash; dizzness, speech problems, even loss of consciousness, are common. This phenomenon is known as   hypoglycemia   or, in cases producing unconsciousness,   hypoglycemic coma    formerly termed   insulin shock   from the most common causative agent . Because endogenous causes of insulin excess  such as an   insulinoma    are extremely rare naturally, the overwhelming majority of hypoglycemia cases are caused by human action  e.g.   iatrogenic  , caused by medicine , and are usually accidental. There have been a few cases reported of murder, attempted murder or suicide using insulin overdoses, but most insulin shock appears to be due to mismangement of insulin  didn't eat as much as anticipated, or exercised more than expected , or a mistake  e.g. 200 units of insulin instead of 20 . 

Causes of hypoglycemia are:
  oral hypoglycemic agents  eg, any of the sulfonylureas, or similar drugs, which increase insulin release from beta cells in response to a particular blood glucose level 
  external insulin  usually injected subcutaneously 

   Diseases and syndromes caused by an insulin disturbance  
There are several conditions in which insulin disturbance is pathologic:
    diabetes mellitus    ndash; general term referring to all states characterized by hyperglycemia 
                              type 1    ndash; autoimmune-mediated destruction of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas resulting in absolute insulin deficiency
                              type 2    ndash; multifactoral syndrome with combined influence of genetic susceptibility and influence of environmental factors, the best known being   obesity  , age, and physical inactivity, resulting in   insulin resistance   in cells requiring insulin for glucose absorption. This form of diabetes is strongly inherited.
   other types of impaired glucose tolerance  see the diabetes article 
    insulinoma   or   reactive hypoglycemia  

  Insulin as a medication  
   Principles   
Insulin is absolutely required for all animal  including human  life. The mechanism is almost identical in nematode worms  ie, ''                        C. elegans  '' , fish, and in mammals. In humans, insulin deprivation due to the removal or destruction of the pancreas leads to death in days or at most weeks. Insulin must be administered to patients in whom there is a lack of the hormone for this, or any other, reason. Clinically, this is called                            diabetes mellitus type 1  .

Harvesting pancreases from human corpses was not possible in practice, so insulin from       cows   or       pigs   or   fish   pancreases was used instead. All have 'insulin activity' in humans as they are nearly identical to human insulin  2 amino acid difference for bovine insulin, 1 amino acid difference for porcine . Insulin is a protein which has been very strongly conserved across evolutionary time. Differences in suitability of beef, pork, or fish insulin preparations for particular patients have been primarily the result of preparation purity and of allergic reactions to assorted non-insulin substances remaining in those preparations. Human insulin can now be manufactured, using   genetic engineering     molecular biology   techniques, in sufficient quantity for widespread clinical use, much reducing impurity reaction problems. Eli Lilly marketed the first such synthetic insulin, Humulin, in   1982  . Genentech Inc developed the technique Lilly used.

    Modes of administration    
Unlike many medicines, insulin cannot be taken orally. It is treated in the   gastrointestinal tract   precisely as any other protein; that is,  reduced to its amino acid components, whereupon all 'insulin activity' is lost. There are research efforts underway to develop methods of protecting insulin from the digestive tract so that it can be taken orally, but none has yet reached clinical use. Instead insulin is usually taken as   subcutaneous     injection  s by single-use   syringe  s with                     needle  s, or by repeated-use   insulin pen  s with needles.

There are several difficulties with the use of insulin as a clinical treatment for diabetes:
  mode of administration
  selecting the 'right' dose and timing
  selecting an appropriate insulin preparation  typically on 'speed of onset and duration of action' grounds 
  adjusting dosage and timing to fit food amounts and types 
  adjusting dosage and timing to fit exercise undertaken
  adjusting dosage, type, and timing to fit other conditions as for instance the increased stress of illness
  the dosage is non-physiologic in that a subcutaneous   bolus   dosage of only insulin is given instead of the pancreas releasing insulin and C-peptide gradually and directly into the   portal vein  
  it is simply a nuisance for patients to inject themselves once or several times a day
  it may be dangerous in the case of mistake  most especially 'too much' insulin 

There have been several attempts to improve upon this mode of administering insulin as many people find injection awkward and painful. One alternative is jet injection  also sometimes used for some vaccinations  which has different insulin delivery peaks and durations as compared to needle injection of the same amount and type of insulin. Some diabetics find control possible with jet injectors, but not with hypodermic injection. There are also 'insulin pumps' of various types which are 'electrical injectors' attached to a semi-permanently implanted needle  a catheter . Some who cannot achieve adequate glucose control by conventional injection  or sometimes jet injection  are able to with the appropriate pump. 

An   insulin pump   is a reasonable solution for some. However there are several major limitations - cost, the potential for hypoglycemic episodes, catheter problems, and, thus far, no approvable means of controlling insulin delivery in the field based on blood glucose levels. If too much insulin is delivered or the patient eats less than normal, there will be hypoglycemia. On the other hand, if too little insulin is delivered by the pump, there will be hyperglycemia. Both of these can lead to potentially life-threatening conditions. In addition, indwelling catheters pose considerable risk of infection and ulceration. Thus far, insulin pumps require considerable care and effort to use correctly. However, some diabetics are able to keep their glucose in reasonable control only on a pump.

Researchers have produced a watch-like device that tests for blood glucose levels through the skin and administers corrective doses of insulin through   pore  s in the skin of the patient. Both electricity and ultrasound have been found to make the skin temporarily porous. The insulin administration aspect remains experimental at this writing. The blood glucose test aspect of such 'wrist appliances' is, at this writing, commercially available essentially as described.

Another 'improvement' would be to avoid periodic insulin administration entirely by installing a self-regulating insulin source. For instance, pancreatic, or beta cell,   transplantation  . Transplantation of an entire pancreas  as an individual                   organ    is technically difficult, and is not common. Generally, it is performed in conjunction with   liver   or   kidney   transplant surgery. However, transplantation of only pancreatic beta cells is a possibility. It has been highly experimental  for which read 'prone to failure'  for many years, but some researchers in Alberta, Canada, have developed techniques which have produced a much higher success rate  about 90  in one group . Beta cell transplant may become practical, and common, in the near future. Several other non-transplant methods of automatic insulin delivery are being developed in the research labs as this is written. None is currently close to clinical approval.

Inhaled insulin is under active investigation as are several other, more exotic, techniques. 

    Dosage and timing    
The central problem for those requiring external insulin is picking the right dose of insulin and the right timing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

Physiological regulation of blood glucose, as in the non-diabetic, would be best. Increased blood glucose levels after a meal is a stimulus for prompt release of insulin from the pancreas. The increased insulin level causes glucose absorption and storage, reducing glycogen to glucose conversion, reducing blood glucose levels, and so reducing insulin release. The result is that the blood glucose level rises somewhat after eating, and within an hour or so returns to the normal 'fasting' level.  Even the best diabetic treatment with human insulin, however administered, falls short of normal glucose control in the non-diabetic. 

Complicating matters is that the composition of the food eaten  see ''  glycemic index  ''  affects intestinal absorption rates. Glucose from some foods is absorbed more  or less  rapidly than the same amount of glucose in other foods. And, fats and proteins both cause delays in absorption of glucose from carbohydrate eaten at the same time. As well, exercise reduces the need for insulin even when all other factors remain the same. 

It is in principle impossible to know for certain how much insulin  and which type  is needed to 'cover' a particular meal in order to achieve a reasonable blood glucose level within an hour or two after eating. Non-diabetics' beta cells routinely and automatically manage this by continual glucose level monitoring and adjustment of insulin release. All such decisions by a diabetic must be based on general experience and training  ie, at the direction of a physician or PA, or in some places a specialist diabetic educator  and, further, specifically based on the individual experience of the patient. It is not straightforward and should never be done by habit or routine, but with care can be done quite successfully in practice.

For example, some diabetics require more insulin after drinking   skimmed milk   than they do after taking an equivalent amount of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and fluid in some other form. Their particular reaction to skimmed milk is different than other diabetics', but the same amount of whole milk is likely to cause a still different reaction even in that same person. Whole milk contains considerable fat while skimmed milk has much less. It is a continual balancing act for all diabetics, especially for those taking insulin.

   Types   
Medical preparations of insulin  from the major suppliers  ndash;   Eli Lilly   and   Novo Nordisk   -- or from any other  are never just 'insulin in water'. Clinical insulins are specially prepared mixtures of insulin plus other substances. These delay absorption of the insulin, adjust the pH of the solution to reduce reactions at the injection site, and so on. Some recent insulins are not even precisely insulin, but so called   insulin analog  s. The insulin molecule in an insulin analog is slightly modified so that they are
 
  absorbed rapidly enough to mimic real beta cell insulin  Lilly's is 'lispro', Novo Nordisk's is 'aspart' , or 
  steadily absorbed after injection instead of having a 'peak' followed by a more or less rapid decline in insulin action    Aventis  ' version is 'Insulin glargine' 
  all while retaining insulin action in the human body.

The management of choosing insulin type and dosage   timing should be done by an experienced medical professional working with the diabetic.

Allowing blood glucose levels to rise, though not to levels which cause acute hyperglycemic symptoms, is not a sensible choice. Several large, well designed,                  long term studies   have conclusively shown that diabetic complications decrease markedly, linearly, and consistently as blood glucose levels approach 'normal' patterns over long periods. In short, if a diabetic closely controls blood glucose levels  ie, on average, both over days and weeks, and avoiding too high peaks after meals  the rate of diabetic complications goes down. If glucose levels are very closely controlled, that rate can even approach 'normal'. The chronic diabetic complications include   cerebrovascular accident  s  CVA or stroke , heart attack, blindness  from proliferative diabetic   retinopathy   , toehr vascular damage, nerve damage from   diabetic neuropathy  , or kidney failure from   diabetic nephropathy  . These studies have demonstrated ''beyond doubt'' that, if it is possible for a patient, so-called   intensive insulinotherapy   is superior to   conventional insulinotherapy  . However, close control of blood glucose levels  as in intensive insulinotherapy  does require care and considerable effort, for   hypoglycemia   is dangerous and can be fatal.

A good measure of long term diabetic control  over approximately 90 days in most people  is the serum level of   glycosylated hemoglobin      HbA1c   . A shorter term integrated measure  over two weeks or so  is the so-called 'fructosamine' level, which is a measure of similarly glyclosylated proteins  chiefly albumin  with a shorter half life in the blood. There is a commercial meter available which measures this level in the field.

   Abuse   
There are reports that some patients abuse insulin by injecting larger doses that lead to mild hypoglycemic states. This is ''extremely'' dangerous and is essentially equivalent to                           suffocation experimentation  . Severe acute or prolonged hypoglycemia can result in brain damage or death.

On   July 23  ,   2004  , news reports claim that a former spouse of a prominent international track athlete said that, among other drugs, the ex-spouse had used insulin as a way of 'energizing' the body. The intended implication would seem to be that insulin has effects similar to those alleged for some   steroid  s. This is not so; eighty years of insulin use has given no reason to believe it to be in any respect a performance enhancer for non diabetics. Improperly treated diabetics are, to be sure, more prone than others to exhaustion and tiredness, and in some of these cases, proper administration of insulin can relieve such symptoms. However, insulin is not, chemically or clinically, a steroid, and its use in non diabetics is dangerous and always an abuse outside of a well-equipped medical facility. Its use in athletes, very few of whom are diabetic, is at best simply foolish, and can be, at worst, quickly fatal.
