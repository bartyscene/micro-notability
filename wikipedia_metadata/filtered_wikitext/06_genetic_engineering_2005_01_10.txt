'''Genetic engineering''', '''genetic modification'''  '''GM''' , and '''gene splicing'''  once in widespread use but now deprecated  are terms for the process of manipulating genes in an organism, usually outside of the organism's normal reproductive process.

It often involves the isolation, manipulation and reintroduction of   DNA   into                  model organisms  , usually to                   express   a   protein  . The aim is introduce new genetic characteristics to an organism to increase its usefulness such as, increasing the yield of a crop species, introducing a novel characteristic, or producing a new protein or enzyme.  Examples are the production of human insulin through the use of modified bacteria and the production of new types of mice like the             OncoMouse  ,  cancer mouse  for research, through genetic redesign.

Since a protein is specified by a DNA segment or   gene  , future copies of that protein can be modified by changing the gene's underlying DNA. One way to do this is to isolate the DNA, cut it, and splice in a different DNA segment.   Daniel Nathans   and   Hamilton Smith   received the   1978     Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine   for their isolation of                      restriction endonucleases  , which are able to cut DNA at specific sites. Together with   ligase  , which can join together fragments of DNA, restriction enzymes formed the initial basis of recombinant DNA technology.

   Naming   
''Genetic modification'' or ''genetic manipulation'' are claimed to be neutral and possibly more technically correct terms for what is claimed, controversially, to be genetic engineering. Opponents question whether the concept of 'modification', with its implications of progress, are applicable here.

Many opponents of the use of the term 'genetic engineering' argue the operations of genes in combination with   cell biochemistry   are rather poorly understood  and sometimes lead to unexpected side effects.

Reluctance to recognize this field as  engineering  has become popular in the   anti-globalization movement   and   safe trade   movement, and is also widely held by most   Green parties  , and the major parties of   France   and   Germany  , which have resisted any   agricultural policy   favoring   genetically modified food  . These groups tend to resist the label 'engineer' as applied to such genetic modification most strongly. 

Defenders of the term ''genetic engineering'' argue that   animal husbandry   and   crop breeding   are also forms of genetic engineering that use   artificial selection   instead of modern  genetic modification techniques. It is politics, they argue, not economics or science, that causes their work to be closely investigated, and for different standards to apply to it than to other fields of   engineering  . These scientists, however, do not object to the term 'genetic modification' as applied to what they do, although it is sometimes used to deny them the status of professionals serving society in an ethical manner, which is one implication of the term   engineer  .

The term  genetic engineering  is sometimes informally abbreviated as  genegineering. 

   Transgenic   organism  is now the preferred term for genetically modified organisms with extra-genome information, as opposed to  genetically engineered  organisms.

   Applications      
One of the best known applications of genetic engineering is   genetically modified organism  s  GMOs .   

There are potentially momentous   biotechnology   applications of GM, for example oral   vaccine  s produced naturally in fruit at very low cost. This represents, however, a spread of genetic modification to medical purposes and opens an ethical door to other uses of the technology to directly modify human genomes.   

These effects are often not traceable back to direct causes in the   genome  , but rather in the environment or interaction of proteins. The means by which 'genes'  in fact   DNA   strands that are assumed to have discrete effects  are detected and inserted are inexact, including such means as coating gold particles with DNA to be inserted and literally firing it at strands of target DNA  see   gene gun   , which is guaranteed to cause insertions in at least some random locations, which can on rare occasion cause unplanned characteristics.   

Similar objections apply to   protein engineering   and   molecular engineering   for use as drugs. However, a single protein or a molecule is easier to examine for '  quality control  ' than a complete genome, and there are more limited claims made for the reliability of proteins and molecules, than for the genomes of whole organisms. While protein and molecule engineers often times acknowledge the requirement to test their products in a wide variety of environments to determine if they pose dangers to life, the position of many genetic engineers is that they do not need to do so, since the outputs of their work are 'substantially the same as' the original organism which was produced by the original genome s .    

An extreme ambition of some groups is   human enhancement   via genetics, eventually by   artificial intelligence   or   molecular engineering  . ''See also:''   transhumanism  . 

    Genetic engineering and research    
Although a there has been a tremendous revolution in the biological sciences in the past twenty years, there is still a great deal that remains to be discovered. The completion of the sequencing of the human genome, as well as the genomes of most agriculturally and scientifically important plants and animals, have increased the possibilities of genetic research immeasurably. Expedient and inexpensive access to comprehensive genetic data has become a reality, with billions of sequenced nucleotides already online and annotated.
Now that the rapid sequencing of arbitrarily large genomes has become a simple, if not trivial affair, a much greater challenge will be elucidating function of the extraordinarily complex web of interacting proteins, dubbed the proteome, that constitutes and powers all living things. Genetic engineering has become the gold standard in protein research, and major research process has been made using a wide variety of techniques, including

  loss of function, such as in a                 knockout   experiment, in which an organism is engineered to lack one or more genes. This allows the experimenter to analyze the defects caused by this mutation, and can be considerably useful in unearthing the function of a gene. It is used especially frequently in   developmental biology  . A knockout experiment involves the creation and manipulation of a DNA construct in vitro, which, in a simple knockout, consists of a copy of the desired gene which has been slightly altered such as to cripple its function. The construct is then taken up by   embryo  nic   stem cells  , where the engineered copy of the gene replaces the organism's own gene. These stem cells are injected into blastocysts, which are implanted into surrogate mothers. Another method, useful in organisms such as drosophila, is to induce mutations in a large population and then screen the progeny for the desired mutation.  A similar process can be used in both plants and prokaryotes.
 gain of function experiments, the logical counterpart of knockouts. These are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene. The process is much the same as that in knockout engineering, except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene, usually by providing extra copies of the gene or attracting more frequent transcription.
 'tracking' experiments, which seek to gain information about the localization and interaction of the desired protein. One way to do this is to replace the wild-type gene with a 'fusion' gene, which is a juxtaposition of the wild-type gene with a reporting element such as green fluorescent protein that will allow easy visualization of the products of the genetic modification. While this is a useful technique, the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene, creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment. More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function, such as the addition of small sequences which will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies.

   Ethics   

Proponents of genetic engineering argue that the technology is safe, and that it is necessary in order to maintain   food   production that will continue to match population growth. However, others argue that food distribution, not production, is the biggest problem, citing that the population growth is actually a result of uneven distribution of food  and wealth .

Others oppose genetic engineering on the grounds that genetic modifications may have unforeseen consequences, both in the initially modified organisms, and their environments.  For example, certain strains of   maize   have been developed that are toxic to plant eating insects  see   bt corn   .  However, when those strains cross-polinated with other varieties of wild and domestic maize, the relevant genes were passed on.  This introduced a new gene into the   gene pool   of the maize population outside of the crop field.  The ecological and environmental effects of   transgenic plants   are constantly being investigated.

Anti-genetic-engineering activists say that with current recombinant technology there is no way to ensure that   genetically modified organism  s will remain under control, and the use of this technology outside of secure laboratory environments carries unacceptable risks for the future.

Some fear that certain types of genetically engineered crops will further reduce   biodiversity   in the cropland;   herbicide  -tolerant crops will for example be treated with the relevant herbicide to the extent that there are no wild   plant  s  'weeds'  able to survive, and plants toxic to insects will mean   insect  -free crops. This could result in declines in other wildlife  e.g.   bird  s  which depend on weed   seed  s and or insects for food resources. The recent  2003  farm scale studies in the                  UK   found this to be the case with GM   sugar beet   and GM   rapeseed  , but not with GM maize  though in the last instance, the non-GM comparison maize crop had also been treated with environmentally damaging pesticides subsequently  2004  withdrawn from use in the   EU   .

Proponents of current genetic techniques as applied to food plants cite the benefits that the technology can have, for example, in the harsh agricultural conditions of third world countries. They say that with modifications, existing crops would be able to thrive under the relatively hostile conditions providing much needed food to their people.  Proponents also like to cite golden rice, a genetically engineered rice variety  still under development  that contains elevated vitamin A levels.  There is hope that this rice may alleviate vitamin A deficiency that contributes to the death of millions annually.  

Proponents say that  genetically engineered crops are not significantly different from those modified by nature or humans in the past, and by extension are as safe or even safer than such methods. There is gene transfer between unicellular   eukaryote  s and   prokaryote  s. There have been no known genetic catastrophes as a result of this.

    Economic and political effects    
Many opponents of current genetic engineering believe the increasing use of GM in major crops has caused a power shift in agriculture towards  Biotechnology companies gaining excessive control over the production chain of crops and food, and over the farmers that use their products, as well.

Many proponents of current genetic engineering techniques believe it has brought higher yields and profitability to many farmers, including those in third world countries.

In April 2004   Hugo Chávez   announced a total ban on genetically modified seeds in   Venezuela  .
