'''Cognitive therapy''' or '''cognitive behavior therapy''' is a kind of   psychotherapy   used to treat                       depression  ,   anxiety disorder  s,   phobia  s, and other forms of   psychological disorder  . It involves recognising distorted thinking and learning to replace it with more realistic substitute ideas. Its practitioners hold that the cause of many  though not all  depressions are                 irrational thoughts  .   Cognitive     therapy   is often used in conjunction with                   mood stabilizing   medications to treat   bipolar disorder  .  According to the U.S-based National Association of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapists:

: There are several approaches to cognitive-behavioral therapy, including Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Rational Behavior Therapy, Rational Living Therapy, Cognitive Therapy, and Dialectic Behavior Therapy.   http:  www.nacbt.org whatiscbt.htm 


  Thoughts as the cause of emotions  
With   thought  s stipulated as being the cause of   emotion  s rather than vice-versa, cognitive therapists reverse the causal order more generally used by psychotherapists.  The therapy is essentially, therefore, to identify those irrational thoughts that are making one unhappy and what it is about them that is irrational; this is done in an effort to reject the depressing thoughts and replace them with more accurate, but also more cheering thoughts.  

Cognitive therapy is not an overnight process. Even once a patient has learnt to recognise when and where his thought processes are going awry, it can take months of concerted effort to replace an invalid thought with a more suitable one. But with patience and a good therapist, cognitive therapy can be a valuable tool in recovery.

  Cognitive behavioral therapy  
While similar views of emotion have existed for millennia, cognitive therapy was developed in its present form by   Albert Ellis   and   Aaron T. Beck   in the   1950s   and   1960s  .  It rapidly became a favorite intervention to study in psychotherapy research in academic settings. In initial studies it was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective.  However, in recent years, cognitive and behavioral techniques have often been combined into cognitive behavioral treatment.  This is arguably the primary type of psychological treatment being studied in research today.

A sub-field of cognitive behavior therapy used to treat       Obsessive Compulsive Disorder   makes use of   classical conditioning   through                             extinction   and   habituation  . Such a procedure has been used successfully by Dr.   Steven Phillipson   to treat OCD.  CBT has also been successfully applied to the treatment of   Generalized Anxiety Disorder   and   Panic Disorder  .

  Depression  
Negative thinking in depression can result from biological sources  i.e., endogenous depression , modeling from parents, or other sources. The depressed person experiences negative thoughts as being beyond their control.  The cognitive therapist provides techniques to give the client a greater degree of control over negative thinking by correcting    cognitive distortion  s  or thinking errors that abet them in a process called   cognitive restructuring  .

Negative thoughts in depression are generally about one of three areas: negative view of self, negative view of the world, and negative view of the future.  These comprise the cognitive triad.  

   The four column technique   
A major technique in cognitive therapy is the four column technique.  It consists of a four step process.  The first three steps analyze the process by which a person has become depressed or distressed.  The first column records the objective situation.  In the second column, the client writes down the negative thoughts which occurred to them.  The third column is for the negative feelings and dysfunctional behaviors which ensued.  The negative thoughts of the second column are seen as a connecting bridge between the situation and the distressing feelings.  Finally, the fourth column is used for challenging the negative thoughts on the basis of evidence from the client's experience.   


  Treating depression with CBA  
The newest and most effective cognitive and behavioral therapy for depression is the cognitive behavioral-analysis system of psychotherapy  CBASP . CBASP is a mix of several of the most successful techniques.  When combined with appropriate antidepressants, it can be extremely effective.

A study published by   Martin Keller   MD of   Brown University   et al in the   May 18  ,   2000     New England Journal of Medicine   compared the   antidepressant     Serzone   with the talking therapy, cognitive behavioral-analysis system of psychotherapy  CBASP . CBASP is largely derivative of other talking therapies such as cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal therapy. Six hundred eighty-one patients with severe chronic depression  some with other psychiatric illnesses  were enrolled in the trial, and were assigned to either Serzone, CBASP, or combination Serzone-CBASP for 12 weeks. The response rates to either Serzone or CBASP alone were rather underwhelming - 55 percent and 52 percent, respectively, for the 76 percent who completed the study. In other words, a little more than half of the completers in those two arms of the trial reduced their depression by 50 percent or better.

The Serzone findings roughly correspond with many other trial results for antidepressants, and underscore a major weakness in these drugs - that while they are effective, the benefit is often marginal and the treatment outcome problematic. Similarly, the CBASP findings validate other studies finding talking therapy about equal in efficacy to taking antidepressants.

The results for the combination drug-therapy group, however, were surprising, with 85 percent of the completing patients achieving a 50 percent reduction in symptoms or better. Forty-two percent in the combination group achieved   remission    a virtual elimination of all depressive symptoms  compared to 22 percent in the Serzone group and 24 percent in the CBASP group.
The authors of the study confessed to being caught by surprise by the results, acknowledging that  the rates of response and remission in the combined-treatment group were substantially higher than those that might have been anticipated .
