The '''Fourier transform''', named for   Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier  , is an   integral transform   that re-expresses a function in terms of                          sinusoidal     basis function  s, i.e. as a sum or integral of sinusoidal functions multiplied by some coefficients   amplitudes  .  There are many closely-related variations of this transform, summarized below, depending upon the type of function being transformed.  See also:   List of Fourier-related transforms  .

  Fourier transform uses  
Fourier transforms have many scientific applications  mdash; in   physics  ,   number theory  ,   combinatorics  ,   signal processing  ,   probability theory  ,   statistics  ,   cryptography  ,   acoustics  ,   oceanography  ,   optics  ,   geometry  , and other areas.   In signal processing and related fields, the Fourier transform is typically thought of as decomposing a signal into its component             frequencies   and their   amplitude  s.  This wide applicability stems from several useful properties of the transforms:

  The transforms are   linear operator  s and, with proper normalization, are                    unitary   as well  a property known as   Parseval's theorem   or, more generally, as the   Plancherel theorem  , and most generally via   Pontryagin duality   .

  The transforms are invertible, and in fact the inverse transform has almost the same form as the forward transform.

  The sinusoidal basis functions are   eigenfunctions   of              differentiation  , which means that this representation transforms linear   differential equation  s with constant coefficients into ordinary algebraic ones.   For example, in a linear time-invariant physical system,   frequency   is a conserved quantity, so the behavior at each frequency can be solved independently. 

  By the   convolution theorem  , Fourier transforms turn the complicated   convolution   operation into simple multiplication, which means that they provide an efficient way to compute convolution-based operations such as   polynomial   multiplication and                            multiplying large numbers  .

  The discrete version of the Fourier transform  see below  can be evaluated quickly on computers, using algorithms based on the   fast Fourier transform    FFT .

  Variants of the Fourier transform  
     Continuous Fourier transform     
Most often, the unqualified term  Fourier transform  refers to the   continuous Fourier transform  , representing any square-                    integrable   function ''f'' ''t''  as a sum of                  complex    exponentials with angular frequencies  omega; and complex amplitudes ''F''  omega; :

: math f t     mathcal F   -1  F  t 
    frac 1   sqrt 2 pi    int_ - infty   infty F  omega  e  i omega t  ,d omega.  math 

This is actually the ''inverse'' continuous Fourier transform, whereas the Fourier transform expresses ''F''  omega;  in terms of ''f'' ''t'' ; the original function and its transform are sometimes called a ''transform pair''. See   continuous Fourier transform   for more information, including a table of transforms, discussion of the transform properties, and the various conventions.  A generalization of this transform is the   fractional Fourier transform  , by which the transform can be raised to any real  power . 

     Fourier series     
The continuous transform is itself actually a generalization of an earlier concept, a   Fourier series  , which was specific to periodic  or finite-domain  functions ''f'' ''x''   with period 2 pi; , and represents these functions as a                        series   of sinusoids:

: math f x     sum_ n - infty    infty  F_n  ,e  inx  ,  math 

where  math F_n  math  is the  complex  amplitude. Or, for               real  -valued functions, the Fourier series is often written:

: math f x     frac 1  2 a_0    sum_ n 1   infty left a_n cos nx  b_n sin nx  right ,  math 

where ''a'' sub ''n''  sub  and ''b'' sub ''n''  sub  are the  real  Fourier series amplitudes.

     Discrete Fourier transform     
For use on computers, both for scientific computation and   digital signal processing  , one must have functions ''x'' sub ''k''  sub  that are defined over ''discrete'' instead of continuous domains, again finite or periodic.  In this case, one uses the   discrete Fourier transform    DFT , which represents ''x'' sub ''k''  sub  as the sum of sinusoids:

: math x_k    frac 1  n   sum_ j 0   n-1  f_j e  2 pi ijk n   quad  quad k   0, dots,n-1  math 

where ''f'' sub ''j''  sub  are the Fourier amplitudes. Although applying this formula directly would require O ''n'' sup 2  sup   operations, it can be computed in only O ''n'' log ''n''  operations using a   fast Fourier transform    FFT  algorithm  see   Big O notation   , which makes Fourier transformation a practical and important operation on computers.  

   Other variants   
The DFT is a special case of  and is sometimes used as an approximation for  the   discrete-time Fourier transform    DTFT , in which the ''x'' sub ''k''  sub  are defined over discrete but infinite domains, and thus the spectrum is continuous and periodic.  The DTFT is essentially the inverse of the Fourier series.

These Fourier variants can also be generalized to Fourier transforms on arbitrary   locally compact     abelian     topological group  s, which are studied in   harmonic analysis  ; there, one transforms from a group to its   dual group  . This treatment also allows a general formulation of the   convolution theorem  , which relates Fourier transforms and   convolution  s.  See also the   Pontryagin duality   for the generalized underpinnings of the Fourier transform.

  Interpretation in terms of time and frequency  

In terms of   signal   processing, the transform takes a   time series    representation of a signal function and maps it into a   frequency spectrum  , where  omega; is   angular frequency  .  That is, it takes a function in the   time   domain into the   frequency   domain; it is a                     decomposition   of a function into   harmonic  s of different frequencies.

When the function ''f'' is a function of time and represents a physical   signal  ,
the transform has a standard interpretation as the   spectrum   of the signal. The                           magnitude   of the resulting complex-valued function ''F'' represents the   amplitude  s of the respective frequencies   omega; , while the                 phase shift  s are given by ''arctan imaginary parts real parts ''.

However, it is important to realize that Fourier transforms are not limited to functions of time, and temporal frequencies.  They can equally be applied to analyze ''spatial'' frequencies, and indeed for nearly any function domain.
