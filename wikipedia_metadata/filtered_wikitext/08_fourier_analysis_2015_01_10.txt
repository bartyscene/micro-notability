  Fourier transforms  
In mathematics, '''Fourier analysis'''    IPAc-en lang pron ˈ f ɔər i eɪ    is the study of the way general                          functions   may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler   trigonometric functions  . Fourier analysis grew from the study of   Fourier series  , and is named after   Joseph Fourier  , who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of   heat transfer  .

Today, the subject of Fourier analysis encompasses a vast spectrum of mathematics. In the sciences and engineering, the process of decomposing a function into simpler pieces is often called Fourier analysis, while the operation of rebuilding the function from these pieces is known as '''Fourier synthesis'''.  In mathematics, the term ''Fourier analysis'' often refers to the study of both operations.

The decomposition process itself is called a   Fourier transform  . The transform is often given a more specific name, which depends upon the domain and other properties of the function being transformed.  Moreover, the original concept of Fourier analysis has been extended over time to apply to more and more abstract and general situations, and the general field is often known as   harmonic analysis  . Each                           transform   used for analysis  see   list of Fourier-related transforms    has a corresponding                    inverse   transform that can be used for synthesis.

  Applications  
  Unreferenced section date September 2008  
Fourier analysis has many scientific applications   in   physics  ,   partial differential equations  ,   number theory  ,   combinatorics  ,   signal processing  , imaging,   probability theory  ,   statistics  ,   option pricing  ,   cryptography  ,   numerical analysis  ,   acoustics  ,   oceanography  ,   sonar  ,   optics  ,   diffraction  ,   geometry  ,   protein   structure analysis and other areas.

This wide applicability stems from many useful properties of the transforms''':'''
  The transforms are   linear operator  s and, with proper normalization, are                    unitary   as well  a property known as   Parseval's theorem   or, more generally, as the   Plancherel theorem  , and most generally via   Pontryagin duality                       .
  The transforms are usually invertible.
  The exponential functions are   eigenfunctions   of              differentiation  , which means that this representation transforms linear   differential equation  s with   constant coefficients   into ordinary algebraic ones                    . Therefore, the behavior of a              linear time-invariant system   can be analyzed at each frequency independently.
  By the   convolution theorem  , Fourier transforms turn the complicated   convolution   operation into simple multiplication, which means that they provide an efficient way to compute convolution-based operations such as   polynomial   multiplication and                                                      multiplying large numbers                      .
  The                              discrete   version of the Fourier transform  see below  can be evaluated quickly on computers using   Fast Fourier Transform    FFT  algorithms.                            

Fourier transformation is also useful as a compact representation of a signal.  For example,   JPEG   compression uses a variant of the Fourier transformation    discrete cosine transform    of small square pieces of a digital image.  The Fourier components of each square are rounded to lower                          arithmetic precision  , and weak components are eliminated entirely, so that the remaining components can be stored very compactly.  In image reconstruction, each image square is reassembled from the preserved approximate Fourier-transformed components, which are then inverse-transformed to produce an approximation of the original image.

   Applications in signal processing   
  Unreferenced section date September 2008  

When processing signals, such as         audio  ,   radio wave  s, light waves,   seismic waves  , and even images, Fourier analysis can isolate individual components of a compound waveform, concentrating them for easier detection and or removal.  A large family of signal processing techniques consist of Fourier-transforming a signal, manipulating the Fourier-transformed data in a simple way, and reversing the transformation.

Some examples include:
    Equalization   of audio recordings with a series of   bandpass filter  s;
  Digital radio reception with no   superheterodyne   circuit, as in a modern cell phone or   radio scanner  ;
    Image processing   to remove periodic or   anisotropic   artifacts such as   jaggies   from interlaced video, stripe artifacts from   strip aerial photography  , or wave patterns from   radio frequency interference   in a digital camera;
    Cross correlation   of similar images for   co-alignment  ;
    X-ray crystallography   to reconstruct a crystal structure from its diffraction pattern;
    Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance   mass spectrometry to determine the mass of ions from the frequency of cyclotron motion in a magnetic field.
   Many other forms of spectroscopy also rely upon Fourier Transforms to determine the three-dimensional structure and or identity of the sample being analyzed, including Infrared and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopies.

  Passive   sonar   used to classify targets based on machinery noise.

    Continuous  Fourier transform   
  main Fourier transform  

Most often, the unqualified term '''Fourier transform''' refers to the transform of functions of a continuous               real   argument, and it produces a continuous function of frequency, known as a ''frequency distribution''.  One function is transformed into another, and the operation is reversible.  When the domain of the input  initial  function is time  ''t'' , and the domain of the output  final  function is             ordinary frequency  , the transform of function ''s'' ''t''  at frequency ''ƒ'' is given by the complex number''':'''

: math S f     int_ - infty    infty  s t   cdot e  - i 2 pi f t  dt.  math 

Evaluating this quantity for all values of ''ƒ'' produces the ''frequency-domain'' function.  Then ''s'' ''t''  can be represented as a recombination of   complex exponentials   of all possible frequencies''':'''

: math s t     int_ - infty    infty  S f   cdot e  i 2 pi f t  df,  math 

which is the inverse transform formula.  The complex number, ''S'' ''ƒ'' , conveys both amplitude and phase of frequency ''ƒ''.

   Fourier series   
  main Fourier series  

The Fourier transform of a periodic function, ''s'' sub ''P''  sub  ''t'' , with period ''P'', becomes a   Dirac comb   function, modulated by a sequence of complex   coefficients  ''':'''

: math S k     frac 1  P  int_ P  s_P t  cdot e  -i 2 pi  frac k  P  t  , dt  math   nbsp;  nbsp; for all integer values of ''k'',

and where  math  scriptstyle  int_P  math  nbsp; is the integral over any interval of length ''P''.

The inverse transform, known as '''Fourier series''', is a representation of ''s'' sub ''P''  sub  ''t''  in terms of a summation of a potentially infinite number of harmonically related sinusoids or                        complex exponential   functions, each with an amplitude and phase specified by one of the coefficients''':'''

: math s_P t   sum_ k - infty   infty S k  cdot e  i 2 pi  frac k  P  t   quad stackrel  mathcal F    Longleftrightarrow  quad  sum_ k - infty     infty  S k    delta  left f- frac k  P  right .  math 

When ''s'' sub ''P''  sub  ''t'' , is expressed as a   periodic summation   of another function, ''s'' ''t'' ''':'''  nbsp; nbsp; math s_P t    stackrel  text def        sum_ k - infty    infty  s t-kP ,  math 

the coefficients are proportional to samples of ''S'' ''ƒ''  at discrete intervals of '''1 P:'''  nbsp; nbsp; math S k    frac 1  P  cdot S left  frac k  P  right . ,  math                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

A sufficient condition for recovering ''s'' ''t''   and therefore ''S'' ''ƒ''   from just these samples is that the non-zero portion of ''s'' ''t''  be confined to a known interval of duration ''P'', which is the frequency domain dual of the   Nyquist Shannon sampling theorem  .

   Discrete-time Fourier transform  DTFT    
  main Discrete-time Fourier transform  

The DTFT is the mathematical dual of the time-domain Fourier series.  Thus, a convergent   periodic summation   in the frequency domain can be represented by a Fourier series, whose coefficients are samples of a related continuous time function:

: math S_ 1 T  f    stackrel  text def        underbrace  sum_ k - infty    infty  S left f -  frac k  T  right   equiv  overbrace  sum_ n - infty    infty  s n   cdot e  -i 2 pi f n T     text Fourier series  DTFT    _  text Poisson summation formula      mathcal F   left     sum_ n - infty    infty  s n    delta t-nT  right   , ,  math 

which is known as the DTFT.  Thus the '''DTFT''' of the ''s'' ''n''  sequence is also the '''Fourier transform''' of the modulated   Dirac comb   function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

The Fourier series coefficients  and inverse transform , are defined by:

: math s n    stackrel  mathrm def        T  int_ 1 T  S_ 1 T  f  cdot e  i 2 pi f nT  df   T  underbrace  int_ - infty    infty  S f  cdot e  i 2 pi f nT  df _  stackrel  mathrm def        s nT   ,  math 

Parameter ''T'' corresponds to the sampling interval, and this Fourier series can now be recognized as a form of the   Poisson summation formula  .  Thus we have the important result that when a discrete data sequence, ''s'' ''n'' , is proportional to samples of an underlying continuous function, ''s'' ''t'' , one can observe a periodic summation of the continuous Fourier transform, ''S'' ''ƒ'' .  That is a cornerstone in the foundation of   digital signal processing  .  Furthermore, under certain idealized conditions one can theoretically recover ''S'' ''ƒ''  and ''s'' ''t''  exactly.  A sufficient condition for perfect recovery is that the non-zero portion of ''S'' ''ƒ''  be confined to a known frequency interval of width ''1 T''. When that interval is  -0.5 T, 0.5 T , the applicable reconstruction formula is the   Whittaker Shannon interpolation formula  .

Another reason to be interested in ''S'' sub ''1 T''  sub  ''ƒ''  is that it often provides insight into the amount of   aliasing   caused by the sampling process.

   Discrete Fourier transform  DFT    
  main Discrete Fourier transform  

The DTFT of a periodic sequence, ''s'' sub ''N''  sub  ''n'' , with period ''N'', becomes another   Dirac comb   function, modulated by the coefficients of a '''Fourier series'''. nbsp; And the integral formula for the coefficients simplifies to a summation  see                                                 DTFT Periodic data   ''':'''

The ''S'' sub ''k''  sub  sequence is what's customarily known as the '''DFT''' of ''s'' sub ''N''  sub .  nbsp;It is also N-periodic, so it is never necessary to compute more than N coefficients.  nbsp;In terms of ''S'' sub ''k''  sub , the inverse transform is given by''':'''

Conversely, when one wants to compute an arbitrary number  N  of discrete samples of one cycle of a continuous DTFT,  nbsp; math S_ 1 T  f , ,  math  nbsp; it can be done by computing the relatively simple DFT of ''s'' sub ''N''  sub  ''n'' , as defined above.  nbsp;In most cases, ''N'' is chosen equal to the length of non-zero portion of ''s'' ''n'' .  nbsp;Increasing ''N'', known as ''zero-padding'' or ''interpolation'', results in more closely spaced samples of one cycle of  nbsp;''S'' sub ''1 T''  sub  ''ƒ'' .  nbsp;Decreasing ''N'', causes overlap  adding  in the time-domain  analogous to   aliasing   , which corresponds to decimation in the frequency domain.   see                                                     Sampling the DTFT     In most cases of practical interest, the ''s'' ''n''  sequence represents a longer sequence that was truncated by the application of a finite-length   window function   or   FIR filter   array.

The DFT can be computed using a   fast Fourier transform    FFT  algorithm, which makes it a practical and important transformation on computers.

   Summary   
For periodic functions, both the Fourier transform and the DTFT comprise only a discrete set of frequency components  Fourier series , and the transforms diverge at those frequencies.  One common practice  not discussed above  is to handle that divergence via   Dirac delta   and   Dirac comb   functions.  But the same spectral information can be discerned from just one cycle of the periodic function, since all the other cycles are identical.  Similarly, finite-duration functions can be represented as a Fourier series, with no actual loss of information except that the periodicity of the inverse transform is a mere artifact.  We also note that none of the formulas here require the duration of  math s ,  math  to be limited to the period, '''P''' or '''N'''.   nbsp;But that is a common situation, in practice.

   Fourier transforms on arbitrary locally compact abelian topological groups   
The Fourier variants can also be generalized to Fourier transforms on arbitrary   locally compact                   abelian     topological group  s, which are studied in   harmonic analysis  ; there, the Fourier transform takes functions on a group to functions on the dual group. This treatment also allows a general formulation of the   convolution theorem  , which relates Fourier transforms and   convolution  s.  See also the   Pontryagin duality   for the generalized underpinnings of the Fourier transform.

   Time frequency transforms   
  details Time frequency analysis  

In   signal processing   terms, a function  of time  is a representation of a signal with perfect ''time resolution,'' but no frequency information, while the Fourier transform has perfect ''frequency resolution,'' but no time information.

As alternatives to the Fourier transform, in   time frequency analysis  , one uses time frequency transforms to represent signals in a form that has some time information and some frequency information   by the   uncertainty principle  , there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the   short-time Fourier transform  , the   Gabor transform   or   fractional Fourier transform    FRFT , or can use different functions to represent signals, as in   wavelet transforms   and   chirplet transform  s, with the wavelet analog of the  continuous  Fourier transform being the   continuous wavelet transform  .

A primitive form of harmonic series dates back to ancient   Babylonian mathematics  , where they were used to compute   ephemerides    tables of astronomical positions .

In modern times, variants of the discrete Fourier transform were used by   Alexis Clairaut   in 1754 to compute an orbit,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
which has been described as the first formula for the DFT,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
and in 1759 by   Joseph Louis Lagrange  , in computing the coefficients of a trigonometric series for a vibrating string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Technically, Clairaut's work was a cosine-only series  a form of   discrete cosine transform   , while Lagrange's work was a sine-only series  a form of   discrete sine transform   ; a true cosine sine DFT was used by                        Gauss   in 1805 for   trigonometric interpolation   of   asteroid   orbits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Euler and Lagrange both discretized the vibrating string problem, using what would today be called samples.                     

An early modern development toward Fourier analysis was the 1770 paper ''  Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations  '' by Lagrange, which in the method of   Lagrange resolvents   used a complex Fourier decomposition to study the solution of a cubic:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Lagrange transformed the roots  math x_1,x_2,x_3  math  into the resolvents:
                                                                                           
: math  begin align 
r_1    x_1   x_2   x_3  
r_2    x_1    zeta x_2    zeta 2 x_3  
r_3    x_1    zeta 2 x_2    zeta x_3
 end align   math 
where ''ζ'' is a cubic root of unity, which is the DFT of order 3.

A number of authors, notably    Jean le Rond d'Alembert  , and   Carl Friedrich Gauss   used   trigonometric series   to study the   heat equation  ,                                    but the breakthrough development was the 1807 paper
''  Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides  '' by   Joseph Fourier  , whose crucial insight was to model ''all'' functions by trigonometric series, introducing the Fourier series.

Historians are divided as to how much to credit Lagrange and others for the development of Fourier theory:   Daniel Bernoulli   and   Leonhard Euler   had introduced trigonometric representations of functions,                       and Lagrange had given the Fourier series solution to the wave equation,                       so Fourier's contribution was mainly the bold claim that an arbitrary function could be represented by a Fourier series.                      

The subsequent development of the field is known as   harmonic analysis  , and is also an early instance of   representation theory  .

The first fast Fourier transform  FFT  algorithm for the DFT was discovered around 1805 by Carl Friedrich Gauss when interpolating measurements of the orbit of the asteroids Juno and Pallas, although that particular FFT algorithm is more often attributed to its modern rediscoverers                              Cooley and Tukey  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

  Interpretation in terms of time and frequency  
In   signal processing  , the Fourier transform often takes a   time series   or a function of   continuous time  , and maps it into a   frequency spectrum  .  That is, it takes a function from the time domain into the   frequency   domain; it is a                     decomposition   of a function into             sinusoids   of different frequencies; in the case of a   Fourier series   or   discrete Fourier transform  , the sinusoids are   harmonic  s of the fundamental frequency of the function being analyzed.

When the function ''ƒ'' is a function of time and represents a physical                               signal  , the transform has a standard interpretation as the frequency spectrum of the signal. The                           magnitude   of the resulting complex-valued function ''F''  at frequency ω represents the   amplitude   of a frequency component whose                 initial phase   is given by the phase of nbsp;''F''.

Fourier transforms are not limited to functions of time, and temporal frequencies.  They can equally be applied to analyze ''spatial'' frequencies, and indeed for nearly any function domain. This justifies their use in such diverse branches as   image processing  ,   heat conduction  , and   automatic control  .
