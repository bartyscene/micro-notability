In   mathematics  , a '''Fourier series''', named in honor of   Joseph Fourier      1768  -  1830   , is a representation of a   periodic function    often taken to have period 2 pi; -- in a sense, the simplest case  as a sum of periodic functions of the form

: math x mapsto e  inx ,  math 

which are   harmonic  s of ''e'' sup ''i x''  sup . By   Euler's formula  , the series can be expressed equivalently in terms of   sine   and   cosine   functions. 

Fourier was the first to study systematically such   infinite series  , after preliminary investigations by   Euler  ,   d'Alembert  , and   Daniel Bernoulli  . He applied these series to the solution of the   heat equation  , publishing his initial results in   1807   and   1811  , and publishing his ''Th√©orie analytique de la chaleur'' in 1822. From a modern point of view, Fourier's results are somewhat informal, due in no small part to the lack of a precise notion of ''                         function  '' and ''  integral  '' in the early nineteenth century. Later,   Dirichlet   and   Riemann   expressed Fourier's results with greater precision and formality. 

Many other                                      Fourier-related transforms   have since been defined, extending to other applications the initial idea of representing any periodic function as a   superposition   of harmonics. This general area of inquiry is now sometimes called   harmonic analysis  .

  Definition of Fourier series  

Suppose ''f'' ''x''  is a complex-valued function of a real number, is periodic with period 2 pi;, and is   square-integrable   over the interval from 0 to 2 pi;.  Let

: math F_n   frac 1  2 pi  int_ - pi   pi f x  ,e  -inx  ,dx.  math 

Then the Fourier series representation of ''f'' ''x''  is given by

: math f x     sum_ n - infty    infty  F_n  ,e  inx .  math 

Each term in this sum is called a '''Fourier mode'''. In the important special case of a               real  -valued function ''f'' ''x'' , one often uses the identity

: math e  inx   cos nx  i sin nx   , !  math 

to equivalently represent ''f'' ''x''  as an infinite linear combination of functions of the form  math  cos nx   , !  math  and  math  sin nx   , !  math , i.e.

: math f x     frac 1  2 a_0    sum_ n 1   infty left a_n cos nx  b_n sin nx  right   math , where

: math a_n    frac 1   pi  int_ - pi   pi f x  cos nx  ,dx  math  and  math b_n    frac 1   pi  int_ - pi   pi f x  sin nx  ,dx  math 

which corresponds to  math F_n    a_n - i b_n    2  , !  math  and  math F_n   F_ -n   .  math

  Convergence of Fourier series  

While the '''Fourier coefficients''' ''a'' sub ''n''  sub  and ''b'' sub ''n''  sub  can be formally defined for any function for which the integrals make sense, 
whether the series so defined actually converges to ''f'' ''x''  depends on the properties of ''f''.

The simplest answer is that if ''f'' is   square-integrable   then

: math  lim_ N rightarrow infty  int_ - pi   pi left f x - sum_ n -N   N 
F_n ,e  inx  right  2 ,dx 0  math 

 this is convergence in the norm of the            space ''L'' sup 2  sup    .

There are also many known tests that ensure that the series converges at a given point ''x''. For example, if the function is   differentiable   at ''x''. Even a jump discontinuity does not pose a problem: if the function has left and right derivatives at ''x'', then the Fourier series will converge to the average of the left and right limits  but see   Gibbs phenomenon   . 

However, a fact that many find surprising, is that the Fourier series of a continuous function need not converge pointwise.  A discussion of the counterexample, along with other positive and negative results in the general spirit of  for functions of type ''X'', the Fourier series converges in sense ''Y''  may be found in   Convergence of Fourier series  .

  Some positive consequences of the homomorphism properties of exp  

Because  basis functions  ''e'' sup ''ikx''  sup  are   homomorphism  s of the real line  more precisely, of the  circle group   we have some useful identities:

  If

: math g x  f x-y   , !  math 

then  if ''G'' is the transform of ''g'' 

: math G_k   e  -iky F_k  , !  math .

  If  math H_k  math  is the transform of  math h   f   g  , !  math , then

: math H_k   F_k G_k  , !  math ,

that is, the Fourier transform of a   convolution   is the product of the Fourier transforms. Vice versa, if  math h   fg  math  then the Fourier transform ''H'' of ''h'' is the convolution of the Fourier transforms of ''f'' and ''g''

: math H_k  sum_ i - infty   infty F_i G_ k-i   math .

  Parseval's theorem  

Another important property of the Fourier series is   Parseval's theorem  , a special case of the   Plancherel theorem   and a form of           unitarity  :

: math  sum_ n - infty   infty  F_n  2    frac 1  2 pi   int_ - pi   pi  f x   2 dx  ,  math 

or, for the real-valued ''f'' ''x''  case above,

: math  frac a_0 2  4     frac 1  2   sum_ n 1   infty  left  a_n 2   b_n 2  right     frac 1  2 pi   int_ - pi   pi f x  2 dx  math .

  General formulation  

The useful properties of Fourier series are largely derived from the   orthogonal  ity and                homomorphism property   of the functions  math e  inx   , !  math .
Other sequences of   orthogonal functions   have similar properties, although some useful identities concerning e.g. convolutions are no longer true once we lose the homomorphism property.
Examples include sequences of   Bessel function  s and   orthogonal polynomials  . Such sequences are commonly the solutions of a differential equation; a large class of useful sequences are solutions of the so-called                          Sturm-Liouville problems  .
