  Fourier transforms  
In   mathematics  , a '''Fourier                        series  '''    IPAc-en lang pron ˈ f ɔər i eɪ    is a way to represent a wave-like function as the sum of simple sine waves. More formally, it decomposes any   periodic function   or periodic signal into the sum of a  possibly infinite  set of simple oscillating functions, namely             sines and cosines     or, equivalently,   complex exponential  s .  The   Discrete-time Fourier transform   is a periodic function, often defined in terms of a Fourier series.  The   Z-transform  , another example of application, reduces to a Fourier series for the important case  z  1.  Fourier series are also central to the original proof of the   Nyquist Shannon sampling theorem  .  The study of Fourier series is a branch of   Fourier analysis  .

  History  
The Fourier series is named in honour of   Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier    1768 1830 , who made important contributions to the study of   trigonometric series  , after preliminary investigations by   Leonhard Euler  ,   Jean le Rond d'Alembert  , and   Daniel Bernoulli  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Fourier introduced the series for the purpose of solving the   heat equation   in a metal plate, publishing his initial results in his 1807 ''  Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides  ''  ''Treatise on the propagation of heat in solid bodies'' , and publishing his ''Théorie analytique de la chaleur''  ''Analytical theory of heat''  in 1822. Early ideas of decomposing a periodic function into the sum of simple oscillating functions date back to the 3rd century BC, when ancient astronomers proposed an empiric model of planetary motions, based on                         deferents and epicycles  .

The heat equation is a   partial differential equation  . Prior to Fourier's work, no solution to the heat equation was known in the general case, although particular solutions were known if the heat source behaved in a simple way, in particular, if the heat source was a   sine   or   cosine   wave. These simple solutions are now sometimes called                                          eigensolutions  . Fourier's idea was to model a complicated heat source as a superposition  or   linear combination    of simple sine and cosine waves, and to write the                            solution as a superposition   of the corresponding                 eigensolutions  . This superposition or linear combination is called the Fourier series.

From a modern point of view, Fourier's results are somewhat informal, due to the lack of a precise notion of                          function   and   integral   in the early nineteenth century. Later,   Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     and   Bernhard Riemann                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 expressed Fourier's results with greater precision and formality.

Although the original motivation was to solve the heat equation, it later became obvious that the same techniques could be applied to a wide array of mathematical and physical problems, and especially those involving linear differential equations with constant coefficients, for which the eigensolutions are             sinusoid  s.  The Fourier series has many such applications in   electrical engineering  ,               vibration   analysis,   acoustics  ,   optics  ,   signal processing  ,   image processing  ,   quantum mechanics  ,   econometrics  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            thin-walled shell   theory,                                                                                                                                                   etc.

  Definition  
In this section, ''s'' ''x''  denotes a function of the real variable ''x'', and ''s'' is integrable on an interval  ''x'' sub 0  sub , nbsp;''x'' sub 0  sub  nbsp;  nbsp;''P'' , for real numbers ''x'' sub 0  sub  and nbsp;''P''.  We will attempt to represent  nbsp;''s'' nbsp; in that interval as an infinite sum, or                        series  , of harmonically related sinusoidal functions.  Outside the interval, the series is periodic with period nbsp;''P''  frequency nbsp;1 ''P'' .  It follows that if ''s'' also has that property, the approximation is valid on the entire real line.  We can begin with a finite summation  or ''partial sum'' ''':'''

In particular, the Fourier series converges absolutely and uniformly to ''s'' ''x''  whenever the derivative of ''s'' ''x''   which may not exist everywhere  is square integrable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          nbsp; If a function is                              square-integrable   on the interval  x sub 0  sub , x sub 0  sub  P , then the Fourier series converges to the function at ''  almost every  '' point.   See   Convergence of Fourier series  .  It is possible to define Fourier coefficients for more general functions or distributions, in such cases convergence in norm or                                    weak convergence   is usually of interest.

This example leads us to a solution to the   Basel problem  

   Example 2: Fourier's motivation   

The Fourier series expansion of our function in example 1 looks much less simple than the formula ''s'' ''x''    ''x π'', and so it is not immediately apparent why one would need this Fourier series. While there are many applications, we cite Fourier's motivation of solving the heat equation. For example, consider a metal plate in the shape of a square whose side measures ''π'' meters, with coordinates  ''x'', nbsp;''y''     0, nbsp;''π''  nbsp;  nbsp; 0, nbsp;''π'' . If there is no heat source within the plate, and if three of the four sides are held at 0 degrees Celsius, while the fourth side, given by ''y'' nbsp;  nbsp;π, is maintained at the temperature gradient ''T'' ''x'', nbsp;''π''    ''x'' degrees Celsius, for ''x'' in  0, nbsp;''π'' , then one can show that the stationary heat distribution  or the heat distribution after a long period of time has elapsed  is given by
:  math T x,y    2 sum_ n 1   infty  frac  -1   n 1   n   sin nx    sinh ny   over  sinh n pi  .  math 
Here, sinh is the   hyperbolic sine   function. This solution of the heat equation is obtained by multiplying each term of  nbsp;  EquationNote Eq.1   by sinh ''ny''  sinh ''n''π . While our example function ''s'' ''x''  seems to have a needlessly complicated Fourier series, the heat distribution ''T'' ''x'', nbsp;''y''  is nontrivial. The function ''T'' cannot be written as a   closed-form expression  . This method of solving the heat problem was made possible by Fourier's work.

   Other applications   

Another application of this Fourier series is to solve the   Basel problem   by using   Parseval's theorem  . The example generalizes and one may compute                         ζ   2''n'' , for any positive integer nbsp;''n''.

   Other common notations   

The notation ''c'' sub ''n''  sub  is inadequate for discussing the Fourier coefficients of several different functions.  Therefore it is customarily replaced by a modified form of the function  ''s'', in this case , such as  math  scriptstyle hat s   math  or ''S'', and functional notation often replaces subscripting:
: math  begin align 
s_  infty  x      sum_ n - infty   infty  hat s  n  cdot e  i tfrac 2 pi nx  P     
    sum_ n - infty   infty S n  cdot e  j tfrac 2 pi nx  P      scriptstyle  text common engineering notation 
 end align   math 
In engineering, particularly when the variable ''x'' represents time, the coefficient sequence is called a   frequency domain   representation. Square brackets are often used to emphasize that the domain of this function is a discrete set of frequencies.

Another commonly used frequency domain representation uses the Fourier series coefficients to modulate a   Dirac comb  :
: math S f     stackrel  mathrm def         sum_ n - infty   infty S n  cdot  delta  left f- frac n  P  right ,  math 

where ''f'' represents a continuous frequency domain.  When variable ''x'' has units of seconds, ''f'' has units of   hertz  .  The  teeth  of the comb are spaced at multiples  i.e.   harmonics    of 1 P, which is called the   fundamental frequency  .  nbsp; math  scriptstyle s_  infty  x   math  nbsp; can be recovered from this representation by an                             inverse Fourier transform  :

The constructed function ''S'' ''f''  is therefore commonly referred to as a '''Fourier transform''', even though the Fourier integral of a periodic function is not convergent at the harmonic frequencies.

This immediately gives any coefficient ''a sub k  sub '' of the trigonometrical series for φ ''y''  for any function which has such an expansion. It works because if φ has such an expansion, then  under suitable convergence assumptions  the integral

In these few lines, which are close to the modern                           formalism   used in Fourier series, Fourier revolutionized both mathematics and physics. Although similar trigonometric series were previously used by   Euler  ,   d'Alembert  ,   Daniel Bernoulli   and                        Gauss  , Fourier believed that such trigonometric series could represent any arbitrary function.  In what sense that is actually true is a somewhat subtle issue and the attempts over many years to clarify this idea have led to important discoveries in the theories of                     convergence  ,   function space  s, and   harmonic analysis  .

When Fourier submitted a later competition essay in 1811, the committee  which included                         Lagrange  ,   Laplace  ,                       Malus   and                         Legendre  , among others  concluded: ''...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and...his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even                       rigour  ''.                                      

   Birth of harmonic analysis   
Since Fourier's time, many different approaches to defining and understanding the concept of Fourier series have been discovered, all of which are consistent with one another, but each of which emphasizes different aspects of the topic.  Some of the more powerful and elegant approaches are based on mathematical ideas and tools that were not available at the time Fourier completed his original work. Fourier originally defined the Fourier series for real-valued functions of real arguments, and using the sine and cosine functions as the                          basis set   for the decomposition.

Many other                                      Fourier-related transforms   have since been defined, extending the initial idea to other applications. This general area of inquiry is now sometimes called   harmonic analysis  . A Fourier series, however, can be used only for periodic functions, or for functions on a bounded  compact  interval.

  Extensions  

    Fourier series on a square    
We can also define the Fourier series for functions of two variables ''x'' and ''y'' in the square   π, nbsp;π    π, nbsp;π :
: math f x,y     sum_ j,k  in  mathbf Z  text   integers    c_ j,k e  ijx e  iky ,  math 
: math c_ j,k     1  over 4  pi 2   int_ - pi   pi  int_ - pi   pi f x,y  e  -ijx e  -iky  , dx  , dy.  math 
Aside from being useful for solving partial differential equations such as the heat equation, one notable application of Fourier series on the square is in   image compression  . In particular, the   jpeg   image compression standard uses the two-dimensional   discrete cosine transform  , which is a Fourier transform using the cosine basis functions.

    Fourier series of Bravais-lattice-periodic-function    
The   Bravais lattice   is defined as the set of vectors of the form:
: math  mathbf R    n_ 1  mathbf a _ 1    n_ 2  mathbf a _ 2    n_ 3  mathbf a _ 3   math 
where ''n sub i  sub '' are integers and '''a''' sub ''i''  sub  are three linearly independent vectors. Assuming we have some function, ''f'' '''r''' , such that it obeys the following condition for any Bravais lattice vector '''R''': ''f'' '''r'''    ''f'' '''r''' nbsp;  nbsp;'''R''' , we could make a Fourier series of it. This kind of function can be, for example, the effective potential that one electron  feels  inside a periodic crystal. It is useful to make a Fourier series of the potential then when applying                   Bloch's theorem  . First, we may write any arbitrary vector '''r''' in the coordinate-system of the lattice:

:  math  mathbf r    x_1 frac  mathbf a _ 1   a_1   x_2 frac  mathbf a _ 2   a_2   x_3 frac  mathbf a _ 3   a_3 ,  math 

where ''a'' sub ''i''  sub     '''a''' sub ''i''  sub  .

Thus we can define a new function,

:  math g x_1,x_2,x_3  :  f  mathbf r     f  left  x_1 frac  mathbf a _ 1   a_1  x_2 frac  mathbf a _ 2   a_2  x_3 frac  mathbf a _ 3   a_3   right  .  math 

This new function,  math g x_1,x_2,x_3   math , is now a function of three-variables, each of which has periodicity ''a'' sub 1  sub , ''a'' sub 2  sub , ''a'' sub 3  sub  respectively:  math g x_1,x_2,x_3    g x_1 a_1,x_2,x_3    g x_1,x_2 a_2,x_3    g x_1,x_2,x_3 a_3   math .
If we write a series for ''g'' on the interval  0, ''a'' sub 1  sub   for ''x'' sub 1  sub , we can define the following:

: math h  mathrm one  m_1, x_2, x_3  :   frac 1  a_1  int_0  a_1  g x_1, x_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  frac m_1  a_1  x_1  , dx_1  math 

And then we can write:

: math g x_1, x_2, x_3   sum_ m_1 - infty   infty h  mathrm one  m_1, x_2, x_3   cdot e  i 2 pi  frac m_1  a_1  x_1   math 

Further defining:

: math 
 begin align 
h  mathrm two  m_1, m_2, x_3    :   frac 1  a_2  int_0  a_2  h  mathrm one  m_1, x_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  frac m_2  a_2  x_2  , dx_2    12pt 
     frac 1  a_2  int_0  a_2  dx_2  frac 1  a_1  int_0  a_1  dx_1 g x_1, x_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  left  frac m_1  a_1  x_1  frac m_2  a_2  x_2 right  
 end align 
  math 

We can write ''g'' once again as:

: math g x_1, x_2, x_3   sum_ m_1 - infty   infty  sum_ m_2 - infty   infty h  mathrm two  m_1, m_2, x_3   cdot e  i 2 pi  frac m_1  a_1  x_1   cdot e  i 2 pi  frac m_2 
 a_2  x_2   math 

Finally applying the same for the third coordinate, we define:

:  math 
 begin align 
h  mathrm three  m_1, m_2, m_3    :   frac 1  a_3  int_0  a_3  h  mathrm two  m_1, m_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  frac m_3  a_3  x_3  , dx_3    12pt 
     frac 1  a_3  int_0  a_3  dx_3  frac 1  a_2  int_0  a_2  dx_2  frac 1  a_1  int_0  a_1  dx_1 g x_1, x_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  left  frac m_1  a_1  x_1  frac m_2  a_2  x_2    frac m_3  a_3  x_3 right  
 end align 
  math 

We write ''g'' as:

: math g x_1, x_2, x_3   sum_ m_1 - infty   infty  sum_ m_2 - infty   infty  sum_ m_3 - infty   infty h  mathrm three  m_1, m_2, m_3   cdot e  i 2 pi  frac m_1  a_1  x_1   cdot e  i 2 pi  frac m_2  a_2  x_2  cdot e  i 2 pi  frac m_3  a_3  x_3   math 

Re-arranging:

: math g x_1, x_2, x_3   sum_ m_1, m_2, m_3  in  Z   h  mathrm three  m_1, m_2, m_3   cdot e  i 2 pi  left   frac m_1  a_1  x_1   frac m_2  a_2  x_2    frac m_3  a_3  x_3 right  .   math 

Now, every ''reciprocal'' lattice vector can be written as  math  mathbf K    l_ 1  mathbf g _ 1    l_ 2  mathbf g _ 2    l_ 3  mathbf g _ 3   math , where ''l sub i  sub '' are integers and '''g''' sub ''i''  sub  are the reciprocal lattice vectors, we can use the fact that  math  mathbf g_i   cdot  mathbf a_j  2 pi delta_ ij   math  to calculate that for any arbitrary reciprocal lattice vector '''K''' and arbitrary vector in space '''r''', their scalar product is:

: math  mathbf K   cdot  mathbf r     left   l_ 1  mathbf g _ 1    l_ 2  mathbf g _ 2    l_ 3  mathbf g _ 3   right    cdot   left  x_1 frac  mathbf a _ 1   a_1   x_2 frac  mathbf a _ 2   a_2   x_3 frac  mathbf a _ 3   a_3   right     2 pi  left  x_1 frac l_1  a_1  x_2 frac l_2  a_2  x_3 frac l_3  a_3   right  .  math 

And so it is clear that in our expansion, the sum is actually over reciprocal lattice vectors:

: math f  mathbf r    sum_  mathbf K   h  mathbf K    cdot e  i  mathbf K   cdot  mathbf r  ,   math 

where

:  math h  mathbf K      frac 1  a_3  int_0  a_3  dx_3  frac 1  a_2  int_0  a_2  dx_2  frac 1  a_1  int_0  a_1  dx_1 f left x_1 frac  mathbf a _ 1   a_1  x_2 frac  mathbf a _ 2   a_2  x_3 frac  mathbf a _ 3   a_3   right  cdot e  -i  mathbf K   cdot  mathbf r  .   math 

Assuming

: math  mathbf r     x,y,z    x_1 frac  mathbf a _ 1   a_1  x_2 frac  mathbf a _ 2   a_2  x_3 frac  mathbf a _ 3   a_3 ,  math 

we can solve this system of three linear equations for ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in terms of ''x'' sub 1  sub , ''x'' sub 2  sub  and ''x'' sub 3  sub  in order to calculate the volume element in the original cartesian coordinate system. Once we have ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in terms of ''x'' sub 1  sub , ''x'' sub 2  sub  and ''x'' sub 3  sub , we can calculate                                   Jacobian determinant  :

: math  begin bmatrix 
 dfrac  partial x_1   partial x     dfrac  partial x_1   partial y     dfrac  partial x_1   partial z     3pt 
 dfrac  partial x_2   partial x     dfrac  partial x_2   partial y     dfrac  partial x_2   partial z     3pt 
 dfrac  partial x_3   partial x     dfrac  partial x_3   partial y     dfrac  partial x_3   partial z 
 end bmatrix   math 

which after some calculation and applying some non-trivial cross-product identities can be shown to be equal to:

:  math  frac a_1 a_2 a_3   mathbf a_1  cdot  mathbf a_2   times  mathbf a_3     math 

 it may be advantageous for the sake of simplifying calculations, to work in such a cartesian coordinate system, in which it just so happens that '''a''' sub 1  sub  is parallel to the x axis, '''a''' sub 2  sub  lies in the ''x''-''y'' plane, and '''a''' sub 3  sub  has components of all three axes . The denominator is exactly the volume of the primitive unit cell which is enclosed by the three primitive-vectors '''a''' sub 1  sub , '''a''' sub 2  sub  and '''a''' sub 3  sub . In particular, we now know that

: math dx_1  , dx_2  , dx_3    frac a_1 a_2 a_3   mathbf a_1  cdot  mathbf a_2   times  mathbf a_3     cdot dx  , dy  , dz.   math 

We can write now ''h'' '''K'''  as an integral with the traditional coordinate system over the volume of the primitive cell, instead of with the ''x'' sub 1  sub , ''x'' sub 2  sub  and ''x'' sub 3  sub  variables:

: math h  mathbf K      frac 1   mathbf a_1  cdot  mathbf a_2   times  mathbf a_3    int_ C  d mathbf r  f  mathbf r   cdot e  -i  mathbf K   cdot  mathbf r     math 

And ''C'' is the primitive unit cell, thus,  math  mathbf a_1  cdot  mathbf a_2   times  mathbf a_3    math  is the volume of the primitive unit cell.

    Hilbert space interpretation    
  main Hilbert space  
In the language of   Hilbert space  s, the set of functions  '' math e_n e  2  pi inx   math ''; ''n''   '''Z'''  is an   orthonormal basis   for the space ''L'' sup 2  sup    π, nbsp;π   of square-integrable functions of   π, nbsp;π . This space is actually a Hilbert space with an   inner product   given for any two elements ''f'' and ''g'' by
: math  langle f, , g  rangle  ; stackrel  mathrm def       ;  frac 1  2 pi  int_ - pi    pi  f x  overline g x   ,dx.  math 
The basic Fourier series result for Hilbert spaces can be written as
: math f  sum_ n - infty   infty  langle f,e_n  rangle  , e_n.  math 
  File:Fourier series integral identities.gif thumb 400px right Sines and cosines form an orthonormal set, as illustrated above. The integral of sine, cosine and their product is zero  green and red areas are equal, and cancel out  when ''m'', ''n'' or the functions are different, and pi only if ''m'' and ''n'' are equal, and the function used is the same.  
This corresponds exactly to the complex exponential formulation given above. The version with sines and cosines is also justified with the Hilbert space interpretation.  Indeed, the sines and cosines form an                   orthogonal set  :
: math  int_ - pi    pi   cos mx  ,  cos nx  , dx    pi  delta_ mn ,  quad m, n  ge 1,  ,   math 
: math  int_ - pi    pi   sin mx  ,  sin nx  , dx    pi  delta_ mn ,  quad m, n  ge 1  math 
 where δ sub ''mn''  sub  is the   Kronecker delta   , and
: math  int_ - pi    pi   cos mx  ,  sin nx  , dx   0; ,  math 
furthermore, the sines and cosines are orthogonal to the constant function '''1'''.  An ''orthonormal basis'' for ''L'' sup 2  sup    π, π   consisting of real functions is formed by the functions 1   sqrt 2π   nbsp;'''1''' and 1   sqrt π   nbsp;cos ''nx'' , thinsp; 1   sqrt π   nbsp;sin ''nx''  with ''n'' nbsp;  1, nbsp;2,... nbsp; The density of their span is a consequence of the   Stone Weierstrass theorem  , but follows also from the properties of classical kernels like the   Fejér kernel  .

   Properties   
We say that ''f'' belongs to  math C k  mathbb T    math  if ''f'' is a 2π-periodic function on '''R''' which is ''k'' times differentiable, and its ''k''th derivative is continuous.

  If ''f'' is a 2π-periodic   odd function  , then ''a sub n  sub ''   0 for all ''n''.
  If ''f'' is a 2π-periodic   even function  , then ''b sub n  sub ''   0 for all ''n''.
  If ''f'' is   integrable  ,  math  lim_  n  rightarrow  infty  hat f  n  0  math ,  math  lim_ n rightarrow   infty a_n 0  math  and  math  lim_ n rightarrow   infty b_n 0.  math   This result is known as the   Riemann Lebesgue lemma  .
  A   doubly infinite   sequence  ''a sub n  sub ''  in ''c'' sub 0  sub  '''Z'''  is the sequence of Fourier coefficients of a function in ''L'' sup 1  sup   0, nbsp;2π   if and only if it is a convolution of two sequences in  math  ell 2  mathbf Z    math . See                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  If  math f  in C 1  mathbb T    math , then the Fourier coefficients  math  widehat f'  n   math  of the derivative ''f '' can be expressed in terms of the Fourier coefficients  math  hat f  n   math  of the function ''f'', via the formula  math  widehat f'  n    in  hat f  n   math .
  If  math f  in C k  mathbb T    math , then  math  widehat f   k    n     in  k  hat f  n   math . In particular, since  math  widehat f   k    n   math  tends to zero, we have that  math  n  k hat f  n   math  tends to zero, which means that the Fourier coefficients converge to zero faster than the ''k''th power of ''n''.

  The first convolution theorem states that if ''f'' and ''g'' are in ''L'' sup 1  sup    π, nbsp;π  , the Fourier series coefficients of the 2π-periodic   convolution   of ''f'' and ''g'' are given by:

One of the interesting properties of the Fourier transform which we have mentioned, is that it carries convolutions to pointwise products. If that is the property which we seek to preserve, one can produce Fourier series on any   compact group  . Typical examples include those   classical group  s that are compact. This generalizes the Fourier transform to all spaces of the form ''L'' sup 2  sup  ''G'' , where ''G'' is a compact group, in such a way that the Fourier transform carries   convolution  s to pointwise products. The Fourier series exists and converges in similar ways to the   π, π  case.

An alternative extension to compact groups is the   Peter Weyl theorem  , which proves results about representations of compact groups analogous to those about finite groups.

  main Laplace operator Riemannian manifold  

If the domain is not a group, then there is no intrinsically defined convolution. However, if ''X'' is a                 compact     Riemannian manifold  , it has a   Laplace Beltrami operator  . The Laplace Beltrami operator is the differential operator that corresponds to   Laplace operator   for the Riemannian manifold ''X''. Then, by analogy, one can consider heat equations on ''X''.   Since Fourier arrived at his basis by attempting to solve the heat equation, the natural generalization is to use the eigensolutions of the Laplace Beltrami operator as a basis. This generalizes Fourier series to spaces of the type ''L'' sup 2  sup  ''X'' , where ''X'' is a Riemannian manifold. The Fourier series converges in ways similar to the   π, nbsp;π  case. A typical example is to take ''X'' to be the sphere with the usual metric, in which case the Fourier basis consists of   spherical harmonics  .

    Locally compact Abelian groups

The generalization to compact groups discussed above does not generalize to noncompact, nonabelian groups. However, there is a straightfoward generalization to Locally Compact Abelian  LCA  groups.

This generalizes the Fourier transform to ''L'' sup 1  sup  ''G''  or ''L'' sup 2  sup  ''G'' , where ''G'' is an LCA group. If ''G'' is compact, one also obtains a Fourier series, which converges similarly to the   π, nbsp;π  case, but if ''G'' is noncompact, one obtains instead a   Fourier integral  . This generalization yields the usual   Fourier transform   when the underlying locally compact Abelian group is '''R'''.

  Approximation and convergence of Fourier series  
An important question for the theory as well as applications is that of convergence. In particular, it is often necessary in applications to replace the infinite series  math  sum_ - infty   infty  math  thinsp; by a finite one,

: math f_N x     sum_ n -N  N  hat f  n  e  inx .  math 

This is called a ''partial sum''. We would like to know, in which sense does ''f'' sub ''N''  sub  ''x''  converge to ''f'' ''x''  as ''N''    .

   Least squares property   
We say that ''p'' is a   trigonometric polynomial   of degree ''N'' when it is of the form

: math p x   sum_ n -N  N p_n e  inx .  math 

Note that ''f sub N  sub  is a trigonometric polynomial of degree ''N''.   Parseval's theorem   implies that

 blockquote '''Theorem.''' The trigonometric polynomial ''f sub N  sub  is the unique best trigonometric polynomial of degree ''N'' approximating ''f'' ''x'' , in the sense that, for any trigonometric polynomial ''p''   ''f sub N  sub  of degree ''N'', we have
: math   f_N - f  _2     p - f  _2,  math 
where the Hilbert space norm is defined as:
: math    g   _2    sqrt  1  over 2 pi   int_ - pi    pi   g x   2  , dx .  math

   Convergence   
  main Convergence of Fourier series  
  See also Gibbs phenomenon  
Because of the least squares property, and because of the completeness of the Fourier basis, we obtain an elementary convergence result.

'''Theorem.''' If ''f'' belongs to ''L'' sup 2  sup    π, nbsp;π  , then f sub    sub  converges to ''f'' in ''L'' sup 2  sup    π, nbsp;π  , that is, thinsp;  math   f_N - f  _2  math  converges to 0 as ''N''    .

We have already mentioned that if ''f'' is continuously differentiable, then  nbsp; math  i cdot n   hat f  n   math  nbsp; is the ''n''th Fourier coefficient of the derivative ''f'' .  It follows, essentially from the   Cauchy Schwarz inequality  , that f sub    sub  is absolutely summable.  The sum of this series is a continuous function, equal to ''f'', since the Fourier series converges in the mean to ''f'':

'''Theorem.''' If  math f  in C 1  mathbb T    math , then f sub    sub  converges to ''f''                       uniformly    and hence also                         pointwise  . 

This result can be proven easily if ''f'' is further assumed to be ''C'' sup 2  sup , since in that case  math n 2 hat f  n   math  tends to zero as ''n''    .  More generally, the Fourier series is absolutely summable, thus converges uniformly to ''f'', provided that ''f'' satisfies a   Hölder condition   of order α nbsp;  nbsp;½.  In the absolutely summable case, the inequality  math  sup_x  f x  - f_N x    le  sum_  n    N    hat f  n    math  thinsp; proves uniform convergence.

Many other results concerning the   convergence of Fourier series   are known, ranging from the moderately simple result that the series converges at ''x'' if ''f'' is differentiable at ''x'', to   Lennart Carleson  's much more sophisticated result that the Fourier series of an ''L'' sup 2  sup  function actually converges   almost everywhere  .

These theorems, and informal variations of them that don't specify the convergence conditions, are sometimes referred to generically as  Fourier's theorem  or  the Fourier theorem .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

    Divergence    
Since Fourier series have such good convergence properties, many are often surprised by some of the negative results. For example, the Fourier series of a continuous ''T''-periodic function need not converge pointwise. The   uniform boundedness principle   yields a simple non-constructive proof of this fact.

In 1922,   Andrey Kolmogorov   published an article entitled  Une série de Fourier-Lebesgue divergente presque partout  in which he gave an example of a Lebesgue-integrable function whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere. He later constructed an example of an integrable function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere                         .
