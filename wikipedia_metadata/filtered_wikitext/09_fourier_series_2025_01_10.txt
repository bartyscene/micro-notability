A '''Fourier series'''    IPAc-en ˈ f ʊr i eɪ ,_ - i ər                                         is an                    expansion   of a   periodic function   into a sum of   trigonometric functions  .  The Fourier series is an example of a   trigonometric series  .                           By expressing a function as a sum of sines and cosines, many problems involving the function become easier to analyze because trigonometric functions are well understood. For example, Fourier series were first used by   Joseph Fourier   to find solutions to the   heat equation  . This application is possible because the derivatives of trigonometric functions fall into simple patterns. Fourier series cannot be used to approximate arbitrary functions, because most functions have infinitely many terms in their Fourier series, and the series do not always                     converge  . Well-behaved functions, for example              smooth   functions, have Fourier series that converge to the original function.  The coefficients of the Fourier series are determined by   integral  s of the function multiplied by trigonometric functions, described in                             Fourier series Definition  .

The study of the   convergence of Fourier series   focus on the behaviors of the ''partial sums'', which means studying the behavior of the sum as more and more terms from the series are summed. The figures below illustrate some partial Fourier series results for the components of a   square wave  .

Fourier series are closely related to the   Fourier transform  , a more general tool that can even find the frequency information for functions that are ''not'' periodic. Periodic functions can be identified with functions on a circle; for this reason Fourier series are the subject of   Fourier analysis   on the   circle group  , denoted by  math  mathbb T   math  or  math S_1  math . The Fourier transform is also part of   Fourier analysis  , but is defined for functions on  math  mathbb R  n  math .

Since Fourier's time, many different approaches to defining and understanding the concept of Fourier series have been discovered, all of which are consistent with one another, but each of which emphasizes different aspects of the topic. Some of the more powerful and elegant approaches are based on mathematical ideas and tools that were not available in Fourier's time. Fourier originally defined the Fourier series for               real  -valued functions of real arguments, and used the                   sine and cosine functions   in the decomposition. Many other                                      Fourier-related transforms   have since been defined, extending his initial idea to many applications and birthing an                        area of mathematics   called   Fourier analysis  .

The Fourier series is named in honor of   Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier    1768 1830 , who made important contributions to the study of   trigonometric series  , after preliminary investigations by   Leonhard Euler  ,   Jean le Rond d'Alembert  , and   Daniel Bernoulli  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .
   Fourier introduced the series for the purpose of solving the   heat equation   in a metal plate, publishing his initial results in his 1807 ''  Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides  ''  ''Treatise on the propagation of heat in solid bodies'' , and publishing his ''Théorie analytique de la chaleur''  ''Analytical theory of heat''  in 1822. The ''Mémoire'' introduced Fourier analysis, specifically Fourier series. Through Fourier's research the fact was established that an arbitrary  at first, continuous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           and later generalized to any   piecewise  -smooth                        function can be represented by a trigonometric series. The first announcement of this great discovery was made by                                Fourier   in 1807, before the                      French Academy  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Early ideas of decomposing a periodic function into the sum of simple oscillating functions date back to the 3rd century BC, when ancient astronomers proposed an empiric model of planetary motions, based on                         deferents and epicycles  .

The   heat equation   is a   partial differential equation  . Prior to Fourier's work, no solution to the heat equation was known in the general case, although particular solutions were known if the heat source behaved in a simple way, in particular, if the heat source was a   sine   or   cosine   wave. These simple solutions are now sometimes called                                          eigensolutions  . Fourier's idea was to model a complicated heat source as a superposition  or   linear combination    of simple sine and cosine waves, and to write the                           solution as a superposition   of the corresponding                 eigensolutions  . This superposition or linear combination is called the Fourier series.

From a modern point of view, Fourier's results are somewhat informal, due to the lack of a precise notion of                          function   and   integral   in the early nineteenth century. Later,   Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and   Bernhard Riemann                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     expressed Fourier's results with greater precision and formality.

Although the original motivation was to solve the heat equation, it later became obvious that the same techniques could be applied to a wide array of mathematical and physical problems, and especially those involving linear differential equations with constant coefficients, for which the eigensolutions are             sinusoid  s. The Fourier series has many such applications in   electrical engineering  ,               vibration   analysis,   acoustics  ,   optics  ,   signal processing  ,   image processing  ,   quantum mechanics  ,   econometrics  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              shell theory  ,                                                                                                                                                                                   etc.

    Beginnings

Multiplying both sides by  math  cos 2k 1  frac  pi y  2   math , and then integrating from  math y -1  math  to  math y  1  math  yields:

This immediately gives any coefficient ''a sub k  sub '' of the   trigonometric series   for φ ''y''  for any function which has such an expansion. It works because if φ has such an expansion, then  under suitable convergence assumptions  the integral

can be carried out term-by-term. But all terms involving  math  cos 2j 1  frac  pi y  2   cos 2k 1  frac  pi y  2   math  for   nowrap ''j''  ne; ''k''   vanish when integrated from  1 to 1, leaving only the  math k   text th    math  term, which is ''1''.

In these few lines, which are close to the modern                           formalism   used in Fourier series, Fourier revolutionized both mathematics and physics. Although similar trigonometric series were previously used by   Euler  ,                           d'Alembert  ,   Daniel Bernoulli   and                        Gauss  , Fourier believed that such trigonometric series could represent any arbitrary function. In what sense that is actually true is a somewhat subtle issue and the attempts over many years to clarify this idea have led to important discoveries in the theories of                     convergence  ,   function space  s, and   harmonic analysis  .

When Fourier submitted a later competition essay in 1811, the committee  which included                         Lagrange  ,   Laplace  ,                       Malus   and                         Legendre  , among others  concluded: ''...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and...his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even                       rigour  ''.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

   Fourier's motivation   
  File:Fourier heat in a plate.png thumb right This resulting heat distribution in a metal plate is easily solved using Fourier's method  
The Fourier series expansion of the sawtooth function  below  looks more complicated than the simple formula  math s x   tfrac x   pi   math , so it is not immediately apparent why one would need the Fourier series. While there are many applications, Fourier's motivation was in solving the   heat equation  . For example, consider a metal plate in the shape of a square whose sides measure  math  pi  math  meters, with coordinates  math  x,y   in  0, pi   times  0, pi   math . If there is no heat source within the plate, and if three of the four sides are held at 0 degrees Celsius, while the fourth side, given by  math y  pi  math , is maintained at the temperature gradient  math T x, pi  x  math  degrees Celsius, for  math x  math  in  math  0, pi   math , then one can show that the stationary heat distribution  or the heat distribution after a long period of time has elapsed  is given by
:  math T x,y    2 sum_ n 1   infty  frac  -1   n 1   n   sin nx    sinh ny   over  sinh n pi  .  math 
Here, sinh is the   hyperbolic sine   function. This solution of the heat equation is obtained by multiplying each term of the equation from            Analysis   Example   by  math  sinh ny   sinh n pi   math . While our example function  math s x   math  seems to have a needlessly complicated Fourier series, the heat distribution  math T x,y   math  is nontrivial. The function  math T  math  cannot be written as a   closed-form expression  . This method of solving the heat problem was made possible by Fourier's work.

   Other applications   
Another application is to solve the   Basel problem   by using   Parseval's theorem  . The example generalizes and one may compute                         ζ   2''n'' , for any positive integer ''n''.

such that the ''Fourier coefficients''  math c_ _n   math  are complex numbers defined by the integral                                                                 
 math display  block  c_ _n     frac 1  P  int_0 P s x   e  -i 2 pi  tfrac n  P  x   ,dx.  math 
The series does not necessarily converge  in the                         pointwise   sense  and, even if it does, it is not necessarily equal to  math s x   math . Only when certain conditions are satisfied  e.g. if  math s x   math  is continuously differentiable  does the Fourier series converge to  math s x   math , i.e.,
 math display  block  s x     sum_ n - infty   infty c_ _n  e  i 2 pi  tfrac n  P  x  .  math 
For functions satisfying the                         Dirichlet sufficiency conditions  , pointwise convergence holds.                  However, these are not                             necessary conditions   and there are many theorems about different types of   convergence of Fourier series    e.g.   uniform convergence   or   mean convergence   .                            The definition naturally extends to the Fourier series of a  periodic                                             distribution    math s  math   also called ''Fourier-Schwartz series'' .                              Then the Fourier series converges to  math s x   math  in the distribution sense.                                

The process of determining the Fourier coefficients of a given function or signal is called '''''analysis''''', while forming the associated trigonometric series  or its various approximations  is called '''''synthesis'''''.

    Synthesis    
A Fourier series can be written in several equivalent forms, shown here as the  math N  text th   math                                                 partial sums    math s_ _N  x   math  of the Fourier series of  math s x   math :

The function can be analyzed over this interval to produce the Fourier series in the bottom graph. The Fourier series is always a periodic function, even if original function  math s x   math  is not.

The harmonics are indexed by an integer,  math n,  math  which is also the number of cycles the corresponding sinusoids make in interval  math  P  math . Therefore, the sinusoids have''':'''

  a   wavelength   equal to  math  tfrac P  n   math  in the same units as  math x  math .
  a   frequency   equal to  math  tfrac n  P   math  in the reciprocal units of  math x  math .

These series can represent functions that are just a sum of one or more frequencies in the   harmonic spectrum  .  In the limit  math N to infty  math , a trigonometric series can also represent the intermediate frequencies and or non-sinusoidal functions because of the infinite number of terms.

    Analysis    
The coefficients can be given assumed, such as a music synthesizer or time samples of a waveform.  In the latter case, the exponential form of Fourier series synthesizes a   discrete-time Fourier transform   where variable  math x  math  represents frequency instead of time. In general, the coefficients are determined by ''analysis'' of a given function  math s x   math  whose   domain of definition   is  an interval of length  math P  math .

It can be shown that the Fourier series converges to  math s x   math  at every point  math x  math  where  math s  math  is differentiable, and therefore:

When  math x  pi  math , the Fourier series converges to 0, which is the half-sum of the left- and right-limit of  math s  math  at  math x  pi  math . This is a particular instance of the                                                              Dirichlet theorem   for Fourier series.

This example leads to a solution of the   Basel problem  .

An example of determining the parameter  math  varphi_n   math  for one value of  math n  math  is shown in Figure 2.

   Common notations   
The notation  math c_ _n   math  is inadequate for discussing the Fourier coefficients of several different functions. Therefore, it is customarily replaced by a modified form of the function   math s,  math  in this case , such as  math  widehat s  n   math  or  math S n ,  math  and functional notation often replaces subscripting''':'''

: math  begin align

In engineering, particularly when the variable  math x  math  represents time, the coefficient sequence is called a   frequency domain   representation. Square brackets are often used to emphasize that the domain of this function is a discrete set of frequencies.

Another commonly used frequency domain representation uses the Fourier series coefficients to              modulate   a   Dirac comb  :
: math S f     triangleq    sum_ n - infty   infty S n  cdot  delta  left f- frac n  P  right ,  math 

where  math f  math  represents a continuous frequency domain. When variable  math x  math  has units of seconds,  math f  math  has units of   hertz  . The  teeth  of the comb are spaced at multiples  i.e.   harmonics    of  math  tfrac 1  P   math , which is called the   fundamental frequency  .  math s x   math  can be recovered from this representation by an                             inverse Fourier transform  :

: math  begin align 
 mathcal F   -1   S f        int_ - infty   infty  left   sum_ n - infty   infty S n  cdot  delta  left f- frac n  P  right  right  e  i 2  pi f x  ,df,    6pt 
    sum_ n - infty   infty S n  cdot  int_ - infty   infty  delta left f- frac n  P  right  e  i 2  pi f x  ,df,    6pt 
    sum_ n - infty   infty S n  cdot e  i 2 pi  tfrac n  P  x       triangleq   s x .
 end align   math 

The constructed function  math S f   math  is therefore commonly referred to as a '''Fourier transform''', even though the Fourier integral of a periodic function is not convergent at the harmonic frequencies.  efn-ua 
Since the integral defining the Fourier transform of a periodic function is not convergent, it is necessary to view the periodic function and its transform as                              distributions  . In this sense  math  mathcal F     e  i 2 pi  tfrac n  P  x      math  is a   Dirac delta function  , which is an example of a distribution.

If  math s  math  is a 2  pi  -periodic function on  math  mathbb R   math  which is  math k  math  times differentiable, and its  math k   text th    math  derivative is continuous, then  math s  math  belongs to the                                      function space    math C k  mathbb R    math .

    Compact groups    
  main Compact group Lie group Peter Weyl theorem  

One of the interesting properties of the Fourier transform which we have mentioned, is that it carries convolutions to pointwise products. If that is the property which we seek to preserve, one can produce Fourier series on any   compact group  . Typical examples include those   classical group  s that are compact. This generalizes the Fourier transform to all spaces of the form ''L'' sup 2  sup  ''G'' , where ''G'' is a compact group, in such a way that the Fourier transform carries   convolution  s to pointwise products. The Fourier series exists and converges in similar ways to the   closed-closed  ''π'',''π''   case.

An alternative extension to compact groups is the   Peter Weyl theorem  , which proves results about representations of compact groups analogous to those about finite groups.

  File:F orbital.png thumb right The   atomic orbital  s of   chemistry   are partially described by   spherical harmonic  s, which can be used to produce Fourier series on the   sphere  .  

    Riemannian manifolds    
  main Laplace operator Riemannian manifold  

If the domain is not a group, then there is no intrinsically defined convolution. However, if  math X  math  is a                 compact     Riemannian manifold  , it has a   Laplace Beltrami operator  . The Laplace Beltrami operator is the differential operator that corresponds to   Laplace operator   for the Riemannian manifold  math X  math . Then, by analogy, one can consider heat equations on  math X  math . Since Fourier arrived at his basis by attempting to solve the heat equation, the natural generalization is to use the eigensolutions of the Laplace Beltrami operator as a basis. This generalizes Fourier series to spaces of the type  math L 2 X   math , where  math X  math  is a Riemannian manifold. The Fourier series converges in ways similar to the  math  - pi, pi   math  case. A typical example is to take  math X  math  to be the sphere with the usual metric, in which case the Fourier basis consists of   spherical harmonics  .

    Locally compact Abelian groups    
  main Pontryagin duality  

The generalization to compact groups discussed above does not generalize to noncompact,                     nonabelian group  s. However, there is a straightforward generalization to                                 Locally Compact Abelian  LCA  groups  .

This generalizes the Fourier transform to  math L 1 G   math  or  math L 2 G   math , where  math G  math  is an LCA group. If  math G  math  is compact, one also obtains a Fourier series, which converges similarly to the  math  - pi, pi   math  case, but if  math G  math  is noncompact, one obtains instead a   Fourier integral  . This generalization yields the usual   Fourier transform   when the underlying locally compact Abelian group is  math  mathbb R   math .

   Extensions   
    Fourier-Stieltjes series    
  see also Bochner's theorem Special cases Wiener's lemma  
Let  math F x   math  be a function of   bounded variation   defined on the closed inverval  math  0,P  subseteq mathbb R   math . The Fourier series whose coefficients are given by                         
 math display  block  c_ _n     frac 1  P  int_0 P   e  -i 2 pi  tfrac n  P  x   ,dF x ,  quad  forall n in mathbb Z ,  math 
is called the ''Fourier-Stieltjes series''. The space of functions of bounded variation  math BV  math  is a subspace of  math L 1  math . As any  math F  in BV  math  defines a   Radon measure    i.e. a                          locally finite     Borel measure   on  math  mathbb R   math  , this definition can be extended as follows.

Consider the space  math M  math  of all finite Borel measures on the real line; as such  math L 1  subset M  math .                              If there is a measure  math  mu  in M  math  such that the Fourier-Stieltjes coefficients are given by
 math display  block  c_n    hat mu n   frac 1  P  int_0 P   e  -i 2 pi  tfrac n  P  x   ,d mu x ,  quad  forall n in mathbb Z ,  math 
then the series is called a Fourier-Stieltjes series. Likewise, the function  math  hat mu n   math , where  math  mu  in M  math , is called a                                                                      Fourier-Stieltjes transform  .                                

The question whether or not  math  mu  math  exists for a given sequence of  math c_n  math  forms the basis of the   trigonometric moment problem  .                                

    Fourier series on a square    
We can also define the Fourier series for functions of two variables  math x  math  and  math y  math  in the square  math  - pi, pi  times - pi, pi   math :
 math display  block   begin align 
f x,y       sum_ j,k  in  Z  c_ j,k e  ijx e  iky ,   5pt 
c_ j,k       frac 1  4  pi 2   int_ - pi   pi  int_ - pi   pi f x,y  e  -ijx e  -iky  , dx  , dy.
 end align   math 

Aside from being useful for solving partial differential equations such as the heat equation, one notable application of Fourier series on the square is in   image compression  . In particular, the   JPEG   image compression standard uses the two-dimensional   discrete cosine transform  , a discrete form of the                              Fourier cosine transform  , which uses only cosine as the basis function.

For two-dimensional arrays with a staggered appearance, half of the Fourier series coefficients disappear, due to additional symmetry.                                                                                                                       

    Fourier series of Bravais-lattice-periodic-function    
                                                                
A three-dimensional   Bravais lattice   is defined as the set of vectors of the form:
 math display  block   mathbf R    n_1 mathbf a _1   n_2 mathbf a _2   n_3 mathbf a _3  math 
where  math n_i  math  are integers and  math  mathbf a _i  math  are three linearly independent vectors. Assuming we have some function,  math f  mathbf r    math , such that it obeys the condition of periodicity for any Bravais lattice vector  math  mathbf R   math ,  math f  mathbf r     f  mathbf R   mathbf r    math , we could make a Fourier series of it. This kind of function can be, for example, the effective potential that one electron  feels  inside a periodic crystal. It is useful to make the Fourier series of the potential when applying                   Bloch's theorem  . First, we may write any arbitrary position vector  math  mathbf r   math  in the coordinate-system of the lattice:
 math display  block   mathbf r    x_1 frac  mathbf a _ 1   a_1   x_2 frac  mathbf a _ 2   a_2   x_3 frac  mathbf a _ 3   a_3 ,  math 
where  math a_i  triangleq   mathbf a _i ,  math  meaning that  math a_i  math  is defined to be the magnitude of  math  mathbf a _i  math , so  math  hat  mathbf a _ i      frac   mathbf a _ i   a_i   math  is the unit vector directed along  math  mathbf a _i  math .

Thus we can define a new function,
 math display  block  g x_1,x_2,x_3   triangleq f  mathbf r     f  left  x_1 frac  mathbf a _ 1   a_1  x_2 frac  mathbf a _ 2   a_2  x_3 frac  mathbf a _ 3   a_3   right  .  math 

This new function,  math g x_1,x_2,x_3   math , is now a function of three-variables, each of which has periodicity  math a_1  math ,  math a_2  math , and  math a_3  math  respectively:
 math display  block  g x_1,x_2,x_3    g x_1 a_1,x_2,x_3    g x_1,x_2 a_2,x_3    g x_1,x_2,x_3 a_3 .  math 

This enables us to build up a set of Fourier coefficients, each being indexed by three independent integers  math m_1,m_2,m_3  math . In what follows, we use function notation to denote these coefficients, where previously we used subscripts. If we write a series for  math g  math  on the interval  math  left   0, a_1 right    math  for  math x_1  math , we can define the following:
 math display  block  h  mathrm one  m_1, x_2, x_3   triangleq  frac 1  a_1  int_0  a_1  g x_1, x_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  tfrac m_1  a_1  x_1  , dx_1  math 

And then we can write:
 math display  block  g x_1, x_2, x_3   sum_ m_1 - infty   infty h  mathrm one  m_1, x_2, x_3   cdot e  i 2 pi  tfrac m_1  a_1  x_1   math 

Further defining:
 math display  block   begin align 
h  mathrm two  m_1, m_2, x_3     triangleq  frac 1  a_2  int_0  a_2  h  mathrm one  m_1, x_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  tfrac m_2  a_2  x_2  , dx_2    12pt 
     frac 1  a_2  int_0  a_2  dx_2  frac 1  a_1  int_0  a_1  dx_1 g x_1, x_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  left  tfrac m_1  a_1  x_1  tfrac m_2  a_2  x_2 right  
 end align   math 

We can write  math g  math  once again as:
 math display  block  g x_1, x_2, x_3   sum_ m_1 - infty   infty  sum_ m_2 - infty   infty h  mathrm two  m_1, m_2, x_3   cdot e  i 2 pi  tfrac m_1  a_1  x_1   cdot e  i 2 pi  tfrac m_2  a_2  x_2   math 

Finally applying the same for the third coordinate, we define:
 math display  block   begin align 
h  mathrm three  m_1, m_2, m_3     triangleq  frac 1  a_3  int_0  a_3  h  mathrm two  m_1, m_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  tfrac m_3  a_3  x_3  , dx_3    12pt 
     frac 1  a_3  int_0  a_3  dx_3  frac 1  a_2  int_0  a_2  dx_2  frac 1  a_1  int_0  a_1  dx_1 g x_1, x_2, x_3  cdot e  -i 2 pi  left  tfrac m_1  a_1  x_1  tfrac m_2  a_2  x_2    tfrac m_3  a_3  x_3 right  
 end align   math 

We write  math g  math  as:
 math display  block  g x_1, x_2, x_3   sum_ m_1 - infty   infty  sum_ m_2 - infty   infty  sum_ m_3 - infty   infty h  mathrm three  m_1, m_2, m_3   cdot e  i 2 pi  tfrac m_1  a_1  x_1   cdot e  i 2 pi  tfrac m_2  a_2  x_2  cdot e  i 2 pi  tfrac m_3  a_3  x_3   math 

Re-arranging:
 math display  block  g x_1, x_2, x_3   sum_ m_1, m_2, m_3  in  Z   h  mathrm three  m_1, m_2, m_3   cdot e  i 2 pi  left   tfrac m_1  a_1  x_1   tfrac m_2  a_2  x_2    tfrac m_3  a_3  x_3 right  .   math 

Now, every ''reciprocal'' lattice vector can be written  but does not mean that it is the only way of writing  as  math  mathbf G    m_1 mathbf g _1   m_2 mathbf g _2   m_3 mathbf g _3  math , where  math m_i  math  are integers and  math  mathbf g _i  math  are reciprocal lattice vectors to satisfy  math  mathbf g_i   cdot  mathbf a_j  2 pi delta_ ij   math    math  delta_ ij    1  math  for  math i   j  math , and  math  delta_ ij    0  math  for  math i  neq j  math  . Then for any arbitrary reciprocal lattice vector  math  mathbf G   math  and arbitrary position vector  math  mathbf r   math  in the original Bravais lattice space, their scalar product is:
 math display  block   mathbf G   cdot  mathbf r     left   m_1 mathbf g _1   m_2 mathbf g _2   m_3 mathbf g _3  right    cdot  left  x_1 frac  mathbf a _1  a_1   x_2 frac  mathbf a _2  a_2   x_3 frac  mathbf a _3  a_3   right     2 pi  left  x_1 frac m_1  a_1  x_2 frac m_2  a_2  x_3 frac m_3  a_3   right  .  math 

So it is clear that in our expansion of  math g x_1,x_2,x_3    f  mathbf r    math , the sum is actually over reciprocal lattice vectors:
 math display  block  f  mathbf r    sum_  mathbf G   h  mathbf G    cdot e  i  mathbf G   cdot  mathbf r  ,   math 

where  math display  block  h  mathbf G      frac 1  a_3   int_0  a_3  dx_3  ,  frac 1  a_2  int_0  a_2  dx_2  ,  frac 1  a_1  int_0  a_1  dx_1  , f left x_1 frac  mathbf a _1  a_1    x_2 frac  mathbf a _2  a_2    x_3 frac  mathbf a _3  a_3   right  cdot e  -i  mathbf G   cdot  mathbf r  .   math 

Assuming

we can solve this system of three linear equations for  math x  math ,  math y  math , and  math z  math  in terms of  math x_1  math ,  math x_2  math  and  math x_3  math  in order to calculate the volume element in the original rectangular coordinate system.

 it may be advantageous for the sake of simplifying calculations, to work in such a rectangular coordinate system, in which it just so happens that  math  mathbf a _1  math  is parallel to the ''x'' axis,  math  mathbf a _2  math  lies in the ''xy''-plane, and  math  mathbf a _3  math  has components of all three axes . The denominator is exactly the volume of the primitive unit cell which is enclosed by the three primitive-vectors  math  mathbf a _1  math ,  math  mathbf a _2  math  and  math  mathbf a _3  math . In particular, we now know that

We can write now  math h  mathbf G    math  as an integral with the traditional coordinate system over the volume of the primitive cell, instead of with the  math x_1  math ,  math x_2  math  and  math x_3  math  variables:
 math display  block  h  mathbf G      frac 1   mathbf a _1 cdot  mathbf a _2  times  mathbf a _3   int_ C  d mathbf r  f  mathbf r   cdot e  -i  mathbf G   cdot  mathbf r     math 
writing  math d mathbf r   math  for the volume element  math dx  , dy  , dz  math ; and where  math C  math  is the primitive unit cell, thus,  math  mathbf a _1 cdot  mathbf a _2  times  mathbf a _3   math  is the volume of the primitive unit cell.

    Hilbert space

As the trigonometric series is a special class of                                           orthogonal system  , Fourier series can naturally be defined in the context of                                  Hilbert space  s. For example, the space of   square-integrable functions   on  math  - pi, pi   math  forms the Hilbert space  math L 2  - pi, pi    math . Its   inner product  , defined for any two elements  math f  math  and  math g  math , is given by:
 math display  block   langle f, g  rangle    frac 1  2 pi  int_ - pi    pi  f x  overline g x   ,dx.  math 
This space is equipped with the   orthonormal basis    math  left  e_n e  inx : n  in  Z right    math .
Then the                               generalized  Fourier series   expansion of  math f  in L  2   - pi, pi    math , given by
 math display  block  f x     sum_ n - infty   infty c_ _n  e  i n x  ,  math 
can be written as

  File:Fourier series integral identities.gif thumb 400px right Sines and cosines form an orthogonal set, as illustrated above. The integral of sine, cosine and their product is zero  green and red areas are equal, and cancel out  when  math m  math ,  math n  math  or the functions are different, and π only if  math m  math  and  math n  math  are equal, and the function used is the same. They would form an orthonormal set, if the integral equaled 1  that is, each function would need to be scaled by  math 1  sqrt  pi   math  .  
The sine-cosine form follows in a similar fashion. Indeed, the sines and cosines form an                   orthogonal set  :
 math display  block   int_ - pi    pi   cos mx  ,  cos nx  , dx    frac 1  2  int_ - pi    pi   cos  n-m x   cos  n m x  , dx    pi  delta_ mn ,  quad m, n  ge 1,   math

 where ''δ'' sub ''mn''  sub  is the   Kronecker delta   , and

Hence, the set

also forms an orthonormal basis for  math L 2  - pi, pi    math . The density of their span is a consequence of the                                                                        Stone Weierstrass theorem  , but follows also from the properties of classical kernels like the   Fejér kernel  .

   Fourier theorem proving convergence of Fourier series   
  main Convergence of Fourier series  

In   engineering   applications, the Fourier series is generally assumed to converge except at jump discontinuities since the functions encountered in engineering are better-behaved than functions encountered in other disciplines. In particular, if  math s  math  is continuous and the derivative of  math s x   math   which may not exist everywhere  is square integrable, then the Fourier series of  math s  math  converges absolutely and uniformly to  math s x   math .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          If a function is                              square-integrable   on the interval  math  x_0,x_0 P   math , then the Fourier series                      converges   to the function at   almost everywhere  . It is possible to define Fourier coefficients for more general functions or distributions, in which case   pointwise convergence   often fails, and convergence in norm or                                    weak convergence   is usually studied.

The theorems proving that a Fourier series is a valid representation of any periodic function  that satisfies the   Dirichlet conditions   , and informal variations of them that don't specify the convergence conditions, are sometimes referred to generically as ''Fourier's theorem'' or ''the Fourier theorem''.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

   Least squares property   
The earlier   EquationNote Eq.2  :
: math s_ _N  x     sum_ n -N  N S n   e  i 2 pi tfrac n  P  x ,  math 
is a   trigonometric polynomial   of degree  math N  math  that can be generally expressed as''':'''
: math p_ _N  x   sum_ n -N  N p n   e  i 2 pi tfrac n  P x .  math 
  Parseval's theorem   implies that:

  math theorem   math_statement The trigonometric polynomial  math s_ _N   math  is the unique best trigonometric polynomial of degree  math N  math  approximating  math s x   math , in the sense that, for any trigonometric polynomial  math p_ _N   neq s_ _N   math  of degree  math N  math , we have:
 math display  block    s_ _N  - s  _2     p_ _N  - s  _2,  math 
where the Hilbert space norm is defined as:
 math display  block     g   _2    sqrt  1  over P   int_P  g x   2  , dx .  math 
  

   Convergence theorems    
  See also Gibbs phenomenon  
Because of the least squares property, and because of the completeness of the Fourier basis, we obtain an elementary convergence result.

  math theorem   math_statement  If  math s  math  belongs to  math L 2  P   math , then  math s_ _N   math  converges to  math s  math  in  math L 2  P   math  as  math N  to  infty  math , that is:  math display  block   lim_ N to  infty   s_ _N  - s  _2 0.  math   
If  math s  math  is continuously differentiable, then  math  i n  S n   math  is the  math n   text th    math  Fourier coefficient of the first derivative  math s'  math . Since   math s'  math  is continuous, and therefore bounded, it is   square-integrable   and its Fourier coefficients are square-summable. Then, by the   Cauchy Schwarz inequality  ,

: math  left  sum_ n ne 0  S n   right  2 le  sum_ n ne 0  frac1 n 2  cdot sum_ n ne 0   nS n   2.  math 

This means that  math s  math  is   absolutely summable  . The sum of this series is a continuous function, equal to  math s  math , since the Fourier series converges in  math L 1  math  to  math s  math :

  math theorem  math_statement  If  math s  in C 1  mathbb R    math , then  math s_ _N   math  converges to  math s  math                        uniformly  .  

This result can be proven easily if  math s  math  is further assumed to be  math C 2  math , since in that case  math n 2S n   math  tends to zero as  math n  rightarrow  infty  math . More generally, the Fourier series is absolutely summable, thus converges uniformly to  math s  math , provided that  math s  math  satisfies a   Hölder condition   of order  math  alpha   1 2  math . In the absolutely summable case, the inequality:
: math  sup_x  s x  - s_ _N  x    le  sum_  n    N   S n    math 

proves uniform convergence.

Many other results concerning the convergence of Fourier series are known, ranging from the moderately simple result that the series converges at  math x  math  if  math s  math  is differentiable at  math x  math , to more sophisticated results such as   Carleson's theorem   which states that the Fourier series of an  math L 2  math  function converges   almost everywhere  .

    Divergence    
Since Fourier series have such good convergence properties, many are often surprised by some of the negative results. For example, the Fourier series of a continuous ''T''-periodic function need not converge pointwise. The   uniform boundedness principle   yields a simple non-constructive proof of this fact.

In 1922,   Andrey Kolmogorov   published an article titled ''Une série de Fourier-Lebesgue divergente presque partout'' in which he gave an example of a Lebesgue-integrable function whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere. He later constructed an example of an integrable function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere.                       

It is possible to give explicit examples of a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at 0: for instance, the even and 2π-periodic function ''f'' defined for all ''x'' in  0,π  by                                                                                                                                                                                     

: math f x     sum_ n 1    infty   frac 1  n 2   sin left   left  2  n 3   1  right   frac x  2  right .  math 

Because the function is even the Fourier series contains only cosines:

: math  sum_ m 0   infty C_m  cos mx .  math 

The coefficients are:

: math C_m  frac 1 pi sum_ n 1    infty   frac 1  n 2   left   frac 2 2  n 3   1-2m   frac 2 2  n 3   1 2m  right    math 

As   mvar m   increases, the coefficients will be positive and increasing until they reach a value of about  math C_m approx 2  n 2 pi   math  at  math m 2  n 3  2  math  for some   mvar n   and then become negative  starting with a value around  math -2  n 2 pi   math   and getting smaller, before starting a new such wave. At  math x 0  math  the Fourier series is simply the running sum of  math C_m,  math  and this builds up to around

: math  frac 1 n 2 pi  sum_ k 0   2  n 3  2  frac 2 2k 1  sim frac 1 n 2 pi  ln 2  n 3   frac n pi ln 2  math 

in the   mvar n  th wave before returning to around zero, showing that the series does not converge at zero but reaches higher and higher peaks. Note that though the function is continuous, it is not differentiable.


