A '''social robot''' is an   autonomous robot   that interacts and communicates with humans or other autonomous physical agents by following social behaviors and rules attached to its role. This definition suggests that a social   robot   must have a physical embodiment  screen characters would be excluded . Recently some robots have been developed that use a screen to display the robot's head. Such a machine is on the borderline of being a robot. If the body only functions as a holder for the screen then such a system cannot be considered a robot but if the robot has some physical motor and sensor abilities then such a system could be considered a robot.

  Background  
While robots have often been described  as possessing social qualities  see for example the tortoises developed by   William Grey Walter   in the 1950s , social robotics is a fairly recent branch of robotics. Since the early 1990s   artificial intelligence   and   robotics   researchers have developed robots which explicitly engage on a social level. Notable researchers include   Cynthia Breazeal  , Tony Belpaeme, Aude Billard, Kerstin Dautenhahn, Yiannis Demiris, Maja Mataric and Brian Scassellati. Also related is the Kansai engineering movement in Japanese science and technology --- for social robotics, see especially work by Takayuki Kanda, Hideki Kozima,   Hiroshi Ishiguro   and Tomio Watanabe.

Designing an            autonomous   social robot is particularly challenging, as the robot needs to correctly interpret people's action and respond appropriately, which is currently not yet possible. As such, many social robots are partially or fully   remote control  led, a method often referred to as                            Wizard of Oz  , after the character in the   L. Frank Baum   book. Wizard of Oz studies are useful to evaluate how people respond to social robots.

  Definition  
The definition states that a social robot should communicate and interact with humans and embodied agents. These are likely to be cooperative, but the definition is not limited to this situation. Moreover, uncooperative behavior can be considered social in certain situations. The robot could, for example, exhibit competitive behavior within the framework of a game. The robot could also interact with a minimum or no communication. It could, for example, hand tools to an astronaut working on a space station. However, it is likely that some communication will be necessary at some point.
Two suggested ultimate requirements for social robots are the   Turing Test   to determine the robot's communication skills and   Isaac Asimov  's   Three Laws of Robotics   for its behavior  The usefulness to apply these requirements in a real-world application, especially in the case of Asimov's laws, still is disputed and maybe not possible at all .  However, a consequence of this viewpoint is that a robot that only interacts and communicates with other robots would not be considered to be a social robot: Being social is bound to humans and their society which defines necessary social values, norms and standards. This results in a cultural dependency of social robots since social values, norms and standards differ between cultures.

This brings us directly to the last part of the definition. A social robot must interact within the social rules attached to its role. The role and its rules are defined through society. For example a robotic butler for humans would have to comply with established rules of good service. It should be anticipating, reliable and most of all discreet. A social robot must be aware of this and comply with it. However, social robots that interact with other autonomous robots would also behave and interact according to non-human conventions.

An example of social robot would be                  Kaspar  , designed by   University of Hertfordshire   to help children with autism learn responses from the robot through games and interactive play.
