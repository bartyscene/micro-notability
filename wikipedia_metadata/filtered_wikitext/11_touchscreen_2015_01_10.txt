A '''touchscreen''' is an   electronic visual display   that the user can control through simple or   multi-touch gestures   by touching the screen with a special stylus pen and-or one or more fingers. Some touchscreens use an ordinary or specially coated gloves to work while others use a special stylus pen only. The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and to control how it is displayed  for example by                        zooming   the text size .

The touchscreen enables the user to interact directly with what is displayed, rather than using a                     mouse  ,   touchpad  , or any other intermediate device  other than a stylus, which is optional for most modern touchscreens .

Touchscreens are common in devices such as   game consoles  ,   personal computer  s,   tablet computer  s, and   smartphone  s. They can also be attached to computers or, as terminals, to networks. They also play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances such as                              personal digital assistants  PDAs   ,   satellite navigation   devices,   mobile phone  s, and   video game  s and some books  Electronic books .

The popularity of smartphones, tablets, and many types of   information appliance  s is driving the demand and acceptance of common touchscreens for portable and functional electronics. Touchscreens are found in the medical field and in   heavy industry  , as well as for   automated teller machine  s  ATMs , and kiosks such as museum displays or   room automation  , where                        keyboard   and                     mouse   systems do not allow a suitably intuitive, rapid, or accurate interaction by the user with the display's content.

Historically, the touchscreen sensor and its accompanying controller-based firmware have been made available by a wide array of after-market   system integrator  s, and not by display, chip, or motherboard manufacturers. Display manufacturers and chip manufacturers worldwide have acknowledged the trend toward acceptance of touchscreens as a highly desirable   user interface   component and have begun to integrate touchscreens into the fundamental design of their products.

This was a further development of the                      self-capacitance screen    right , also developed by Stumpe at CERN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   in 1972.  
E.A. Johnson described his work on capacitive touch screens in a short article which is published in 1965                                                                                                                                                                                                                 and then more fully along with photographs and diagrams in an article published in 1967.                                                                                                                                                                                                         A description of the applicability of the touch technology for air traffic control was described in an article published in 1968.                                                                                                                                                                                  Frank Beck and Bent Stumpe, engineers from   CERN  , developed a transparent touch screen in the early 1970s and it was manufactured by CERN and put to use in 1973.                                                                                                                              This touchscreen was based on Bent Stumpe's work at a television factory in the early 1960s. A resistive touch screen was developed by American inventor G. Samuel Hurst who received US patent  3,911,215 on Oct. 7, 1975.                                                                                                                                                                           The first version was produced in 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                        

In 1972, a group at the   University of Illinois   filed for a patent on an optical touch screen.                                                                                                                                                          These touch screens became a standard part of the   Magnavox   Plato IV Student Terminal.  Thousands of these were built for the   PLATO IV   system.  These touch screens had a crossed array of 16 by 16   infrared   position sensors, each composed of an   LED   on one edge of the screen and a matched   phototransistor   on the other edge, all mounted in front of a monochrome plasma display panel.  This arrangement can sense any fingertip-sized opaque object in close proximity to the screen.  A similar touch screen was used on  the   HP-150   starting in 1983; this was one of the world's earliest commercial touchscreen computers.                                                                                                                                                                        HP mounted their   infrared     transmitter  s and receivers around the bezel of a 9    Sony     Cathode Ray Tube    CRT .

In the early 1980s   General Motors   tasked its   Delco Electronics   division with a project aimed at replacing an automobile's non essential functions  i.e. other than throttle, transmission, braking and steering  from mechanical or electro-mechanical systems with                             solid state   alternatives wherever possible. The finished device was dubbed the ECC for  Electronic Control Center , a   digital computer   and   software   control system hardwired to various   peripheral     sensors  ,   servos  ,   solenoids  ,                   antenna   and a   monochrome   CRT touchscreen that functioned both as display and sole method of input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The EEC replaced the traditional mechanical                 stereo  , fan, heater and                               air conditioner   controls and displays, and was capable of providing very detailed and specific information about the vehicle's cumulative and current operating status in                               real time  . The ECC was standard equipment on the 1985-1989                                    Buick Riviera   and later the 1988-89   Buick Reatta  , but was unpopular with consumers partly due to   technophobia   on behalf of some traditional   Buick   customers, but mostly because of costly to repair technical problems suffered by the ECC's touchscreen which being the sole access method, would render climate control or stereo operation impossible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

  Multi-touch technology   began in 1982, when the University of Toronto's Input Research Group developed the first human-input multi-touch system, using a frosted-glass panel with a camera placed behind the glass.  In 1985, the University of Toronto group including Bill Buxton developed a multi-touch tablet that used capacitance rather than bulky camera-based optical sensing systems  see                                      History of multi-touch   .

In 1986 the first graphical point of sale software was demonstrated on the 16-bit   Atari 520ST   color computer. It featured a color touchscreen widget-driven interface.                                                                                                                                   The   ViewTouch                                                                                                                                                                    point of sale software was first shown by its developer,   Gene Mosher  , at Fall Comdex, 1986, in Las Vegas, Nevada to visitors at the Atari Computer demonstration area and was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface.                                                                                                                                                                                          

In 1987 Casio launched the   Casio PB-1000   pocket computer with a touch screen consisting of a 4x4 matrix, resulting in 16 touch areas in its small LCD graphic screen.

In c. 1991-1992, the                     Sun   Star7 prototype                              PDA   implemented a touchscreen with                       inertial scrolling  .                                                                                          In 1993, the   IBM Simon   - the first touchscreen phone - was released.

An early attempt at a   handheld game console   with touchscreen                   controls   was   Sega  's intended successor to the   Game Gear  , though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the expensive cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s. Touchscreens would not be popularly used for video games until the release of the   Nintendo DS   in 2004.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Until recently, most consumer touchscreens could only sense one point of contact at a time, and few have had the capability to sense how hard one is touching. This has changed with the commercialization of   multi-touch   technology.

  Technologies  
There are a variety of touchscreen technologies that have different methods of sensing touch.                     

   Resistive   
  Main Resistive touchscreen  
A   resistive   touchscreen panel comprises several layers, the most important of which are two thin, transparent electrically-resistive layers separated by a thin space. These layers face each other with a thin gap between. The top screen  the screen that is touched  has a coating on the underside surface of the screen. Just beneath it is a similar resistive layer on top of its substrate. One layer has conductive connections along its sides, the other along top and bottom. A voltage is applied to one layer, and sensed by the other. When an object, such as a fingertip or stylus tip, presses down onto the outer surface, the two layers touch to become connected at that point: The panel then behaves as a pair of   voltage divider  s, one axis at a time. By rapidly switching between each layer, the position of a pressure on the screen can be read.

Resistive touch is used in restaurants, factories and hospitals due to its high resistance to liquids and contaminants. A major benefit of resistive touch technology is its low cost. Additionally, as only sufficient pressure is necessary for the touch to be sensed, they may be used with gloves on, or by using anything rigid as a finger stylus substitute. Disadvantages include the need to press down, and a risk of damage by sharp objects. Resistive touchscreens also suffer from poorer contrast, due to having additional reflections from the extra layers of material  separated by an air gap  placed over the screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

   Surface acoustic wave   
  Main Surface acoustic wave  

  Surface acoustic wave    SAW  technology also uses              ultrasonic   waves that pass over the touchscreen panel. When the panel is touched, a portion of the wave is absorbed. This change in the ultrasonic waves registers the position of the touch event and sends this information to the                          controller   for processing. Surface acoustic wave touchscreen panels can be damaged by outside elements. Contaminants on the surface can also interfere with the functionality of the touchscreen.                                     

   Capacitive

  Main Capacitive sensing  

A capacitive touchscreen panel consists of an                          insulator   such as   glass  , coated with a transparent                        conductor   such as   indium tin oxide    ITO .                                      As the human body is also an electrical conductor, touching the surface of the screen results in a distortion of the screen's   electrostatic   field, measurable as a change in   capacitance  . Different technologies may be used to determine the location of the touch. The location is then sent to the                          controller   for processing.

Unlike a   resistive touchscreen  , one cannot use a capacitive touchscreen through most types of electrically insulating material, such as gloves. This disadvantage especially affects usability in consumer electronics, such as touch tablet PCs and capacitive smartphones in cold weather. It can be overcome with a special capacitive stylus, or a special-application glove with an embroidered patch of conductive thread passing through it and contacting the user's fingertip.

The largest capacitive display manufacturers continue to develop thinner and more accurate touchscreens, with touchscreens for   mobile device  s now being produced with 'in-cell' technology that eliminates a layer, such as Samsung's                       Super AMOLED   screens, by building the capacitors inside the display itself. This type of touchscreen reduces the visible distance  within millimetres  between the user's finger and what the user is touching on the screen, creating a more direct contact with the content displayed and enabling               taps and gestures   to be more responsive.

A simple parallel plate capacitor has two conductors separated by a dielectric layer. Most of the energy in this system is concentrated directly between the plates. Some of the energy spills over into the area outside the plates, and the electric field lines associated with this effect are called fringing fields. Part of the challenge of making a practical capacitive sensor is to design a set of printed circuit traces which direct fringing fields into an active sensing area accessible to a user. A parallel plate capacitor is not a good choice for such a sensor pattern. Placing a finger near fringing electric fields adds conductive surface area to the capacitive system. The additional charge storage capacity added by the finger is known as finger capacitance, CF. The capacitance of the sensor without a finger present is denoted as CP in this article, which stands for parasitic capacitance.

    Surface capacitance    
In this basic technology, only one side of the insulator is coated with a conductive layer. A small   voltage   is applied to the layer, resulting in a uniform electrostatic field. When a                        conductor  , such as a human finger, touches the uncoated surface, a   capacitor   is dynamically formed. The sensor's                          controller   can determine the location of the touch indirectly from the change in the   capacitance   as measured from the four corners of the panel. As it has no moving parts, it is moderately durable but has limited resolution, is prone to false signals from parasitic   capacitive coupling  , and needs   calibration   during manufacture. It is therefore most often used in simple applications such as industrial controls and                     kiosks  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

    Projected capacitance

  File:TouchScreen projective capacitive.svg thumb Schema of projected-capacitive touchscreen  
Projected Capacitive Touch  PCT; also PCAP  technology is a variant of capacitive touch technology. All PCT touch screens are made up of a matrix of rows and columns of conductive material, layered on sheets of glass. This can be done either by                              etching   a single conductive layer to form a grid pattern of   electrode  s, or by etching two separate, perpendicular layers of conductive material with parallel lines or tracks to form a grid. Voltage applied to this grid creates a uniform electrostatic field, which can be measured. When a conductive object, such as a finger, comes into contact with a PCT panel, it distorts the local electrostatic field at that point. This is measurable as a change in capacitance. If a finger bridges the gap between two of the  tracks , the charge field is further interrupted and detected by the controller. The capacitance can be changed and measured at every individual point on the grid  intersection . Therefore, this system is able to accurately track touches.                                                                                                                                      
Due to the top layer of a PCT being glass, it is a more robust solution than less costly resistive touch technology. Additionally, unlike traditional capacitive touch technology, it is possible for a PCT system to sense a passive stylus or gloved fingers. However, moisture on the surface of the panel, high humidity, or collected dust can interfere with the performance of a PCT system. There are two types of PCT: mutual capacitance and self-capacitance.

     Mutual capacitance     

This is a common PCT approach, which makes use of the fact that most conductive objects are able to hold a charge if they are very close together. In mutual capacitive sensors, a   capacitor   is inherently formed by the row trace and column trace at each intersection of the grid. A 16-by-14 array, for example, would have 224 independent capacitors. A   voltage   is applied to the rows or columns. Bringing a finger or conductive stylus close to the surface of the sensor changes the local electrostatic field which reduces the mutual capacitance. The capacitance change at every individual point on the grid can be measured to accurately determine the touch location by measuring the voltage in the other axis. Mutual capacitance allows   multi-touch   operation where multiple fingers, palms or styli can be accurately tracked at the same time.

     Self-capacitance     

Self-capacitance sensors can have the same X-Y grid as mutual capacitance sensors, but the columns and rows operate independently. With self-capacitance, the capacitive load of a finger is measured on each column or row electrode by a current meter. This method produces a stronger signal than mutual capacitance, but it is unable to resolve accurately more than one finger, which results in  ghosting , or misplaced location sensing..

   Infrared grid   
  Image:Platovterm1981.jpg right thumb Infrared sensors mounted around the display watch for a user's touchscreen input on this PLATO V terminal in 1981. The monochromatic plasma display's characteristic orange glow is illustrated.  

An   infrared   touchscreen uses an array of X-Y infrared                        LED   and   photodetector   pairs around the edges of the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams. These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns. This helps the sensors pick up the exact location of the touch. A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any input including a finger, gloved finger, stylus or pen. It is generally used in outdoor applications and   point of sale   systems which can not rely on a                        conductor    such as a bare finger  to activate the touchscreen. Unlike                      capacitive touchscreens  , infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and optical clarity of the overall system. Infrared touchscreens are sensitive to dirt dust that can interfere with the IR beams, and suffer from parallax in curved surfaces and accidental press when the user hovers his her finger over the screen while searching for the item to be selected.

   Infrared acrylic projection   
A translucent acrylic sheet is used as a rear projection screen to display information.  The edges of the acrylic sheet are illuminated by infrared LEDs, and infrared cameras are focused on the back of the sheet.  Objects placed on the sheet are detectable by the cameras.  When the sheet is touched by the user the deformation results in leakage of infrared light, which peaks at the points of maximum pressure indicating the user's touch location.  Microsoft's                        PixelSense   tables use this technology.

   Optical imaging   
  Optical touchscreen  s are a relatively modern development in touchscreen technology, in which two or more image sensors are placed around the edges  mostly the corners  of the screen. Infrared back lights are placed in the camera's field of view on the other side of the screen. A touch shows up as a shadow and each pair of cameras can then be pinpointed to locate the touch or even measure the size of the touching object  see                                 visual hull   . This technology is growing in popularity, due to its scalability, versatility, and affordability, especially for bigger units.

   Dispersive signal technology   
Introduced in 2002 by   3M  , this system uses sensors to detect the   piezoelectricity   in the glass that occurs due to a touch. Complex algorithms then interpret this information and provide the actual location of the touch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The technology claims to be unaffected by dust and other outside elements, including scratches. Since there is no need for additional elements on screen, it also claims to provide excellent optical clarity. Also, since mechanical vibrations are used to detect a touch event, any object can be used to generate these events, including fingers and stylus. A downside is that after the initial touch the system cannot detect a motionless finger.

   Acoustic pulse recognition   
The key to  this technology is that a touch at any one position on the surface generates a sound wave in the substrate which then produces a unique combined sound after being picked up by three or more tiny transducers attached to the edges of the touchscreen. The sound is then digitized by the controller and compared to a list of pre-recorded sounds for every position on the surface. The cursor position is instantly updated to the touch location. A moving touch is tracked by rapid repetition of this process. Extraneous and ambient sounds are ignored since they do not match any stored sound profile. The technology differs from other attempts to recognize the position of touch with transducers or microphones in using a simple table look-up method, rather than requiring powerful and expensive signal processing hardware to attempt to calculate the touch location without any references. As with the dispersive signal technology system, a motionless finger cannot be detected after the initial touch. However, for the same reason, the touch recognition is not disrupted by any resting objects. The technology was created by SoundTouch Ltd in the early 2000s, as described by the patent family EP1852772, and introduced to the market by   Tyco International  's Elo division in 2006 as Acoustic Pulse Recognition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The touchscreen used by Elo is made of ordinary glass, giving good durability and optical clarity. APR is usually able to function with scratches and dust on the screen with good accuracy. The technology is also well suited to displays that are physically larger.

  Construction  
There are several principal ways to build a touchscreen. The key goals are to recognize one or more fingers touching a display, to interpret the command that this represents, and to communicate the command to the appropriate application.

In the most popular techniques, the capacitive or resistive approach, there are typically four layers:

  Top polyester coated with a transparent metallic conductive coating on the bottom
  Adhesive spacer
  Glass layer coated with a transparent metallic conductive coating on the top
  Adhesive layer on the backside of the glass for mounting.

When a user touches the surface, the system records the change in the electrical current that flows through the display.

Dispersive-signal technology which   3M   created in 2002, measures the   piezoelectric effect   the voltage generated when mechanical force is applied to a material that occurs chemically when a strengthened glass substrate is touched.

There are two infrared-based approaches. In one, an array of sensors detects a finger touching or almost touching the display, thereby interrupting light beams projected over the screen. In the other, bottom-mounted                        infrared cameras   record screen touches.

In each case, the system determines the intended command based on the controls showing on the screen at the time and the location of the touch.

  Development  
The development of multipoint touchscreens facilitated the tracking of more than one finger on the screen; thus, operations that require more than one finger are possible. These devices also allow multiple users to interact with the touchscreen simultaneously.

With the growing use of touchscreens, the   marginal cost   of touchscreen technology is routinely absorbed into the products that incorporate it and is nearly eliminated. Touchscreens now have proven reliability. Thus, touchscreen displays are found today in airplanes, automobiles, gaming consoles, machine control systems, appliances, and handheld display devices including the   Nintendo DS   and multi-touch enabled cellphones; the touchscreen market for mobile devices is projected to produce US 5 billion in 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

The ability to accurately point on the screen itself is also advancing with the emerging   graphics tablet screen hybrid  s.

TapSense, announced in October 2011, allows touchscreens to distinguish what part of the hand was used for input, such as the fingertip, knuckle and fingernail. This could be used in a variety of ways, for example, to copy and paste, to capitalize letters, to activate different drawing modes, and similar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

  Ergonomics and usage  

   Touchscreen Accuracy   
Users must be able to accurately select targets on touchscreens, and avoid accidental selection of adjacent targets, to effectively use a touchscreen input device. The design of touchscreen interfaces must reflect both technical capabilities of the system,                                ergonomics  ,   cognitive psychology   and   human physiology  . 

Guidelines for touchscreen designs were first developed in the 1990s, based on early research and actual use of older systems, so assume the use of contemporary sensing technology such as infrared grids. These types of touchscreens are highly dependent on the size of the users fingers, so their guidelines are less relevant for the bulk of modern devices, using capacitive or resistive touch technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             From the mid-2000s onward, makers of   operating systems   for   smartphones   have promulgated standards, but these vary between manufacturers, and allow for significant variation in size based on technology changes, so are unsuitable from a                                human factors   perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

Much more important is the accuracy humans have in selecting targets with their finger or a pen stylus. The accuracy of user selection varies by position on the screen. Users are most accurate at the center, less so at the left and right edges, and much less accurate at the top and especially bottom edges. The                           R95   accuracy varies from 7 mm in the center, to 12 mm in the lower corners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Users are subconsciously aware of this, and are also slightly slower, taking more time to select smaller targets, and any at the edges and corners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

This inaccuracy is a result of   parallax  , visual acuity and the speed of the feedback loop between the eyes and fingers. The precision of the human finger alone is much, much higher than this, so when assistive technologies are provided such as on-screen magnifiers, users can move their finger  once in contact with the screen  with precision as small as 0.1 mm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

   Hand Position, Digit Used   Switching   
Users of handheld and portable touchscreen devices hold them in a variety of ways, and routinely change their method of holding and selection to suit the position and type of input. There are four basic types of handheld interaction:

  Holding at least in part with both hands, tapping with a single thumb. 
  Holding with one hand, tapping with the finger  or rarely, thumb  of another hand. 
  Holding the device in one hand, and tapping with the thumb from that hand.
  Holding with two hands and tapping with both thumbs. 

Use rates vary widely. While two-thumb tapping is encountered rarely  1-3   for many general interactions, it is used for 41  of typing interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

In addition, devices are often placed on surfaces  desks or tables  and tablets especially are used in stands. The user may point, select or gesture in these cases with their finger or thumb, and also varies the use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

   Combined with Haptics   
Touchscreens are often used with                     haptic   response systems. A common example of this technology is the vibratory feedback provided when a button on the touchscreen is tapped. Haptics are used to improve the user's experience with touchscreens by providing simulated tactile feedback, and can be designed to react immediately, partly countering on-screen response latency. Research from the University of Glasgow Scotland  Brewster, Chohan, and Brown 2007 and more recently Hogan  demonstrates that sample users reduce input errors  20  , increase input speed  20  , and lower their cognitive load  40   when touchscreens are combined with haptics or tactile feedback  vs. non-haptic touchscreens .

    Gorilla arm    
Extended use of gestural interfaces without the ability of the user to rest their arm is referred to as   gorilla arm.                                                                                                                                           It can result in fatigue, and even repetitive stress injury when routinely used in a work setting. Certain early pen-based interfaces required the operator to work in this position for much of the work day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Allowing the user to rest their hand or arm on the input device or a frame around it is a solution for this in many contexts. This phenomenon is often cited as a ''  prima facie  '' example of what not to do in ergonomics. 

Unsupported touchscreens are still fairly common in applications such as ATMs and data kiosks, but are not an issue as the typical user only engages for brief and widely spaced periods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

   Fingerprints

Touchscreens can suffer from the problem of fingerprints on the display. This can be mitigated by the use of materials with   optical coating  s designed to reduce the visible effects of fingerprint oils, or   oleophobic   coatings as most of the modern smartphones, which lessen the actual amount of oil residue, or by installing a matte-finish anti-glare screen protector, which creates a slightly roughened surface that does not easily retain smudges, or by reducing skin contact by using a fingernail or stylus.
