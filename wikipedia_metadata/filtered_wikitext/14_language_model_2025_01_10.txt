A '''language model''' is a probabilistic                          model   of a natural language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In 1980, the first significant statistical language model was proposed, and during the decade IBM performed                   Shannon  -style  experiments, in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

Language models are useful for a variety of tasks, including   speech recognition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             helping prevent predictions of low-probability  e.g. nonsense  sequences ,   machine translation  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               natural language generation    generating more human-like text ,   optical character recognition  ,   route optimization  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          handwriting recognition  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    grammar induction  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             and   information retrieval  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

  Large language model  s, currently their most advanced form, are a combination of larger datasets  frequently using words                scraped   from the public   internet   ,   feedforward neural network  s, and                                  transformer  s. They have superseded   recurrent neural network  -based models, which had previously superseded the pure statistical models, such as                              word ''n''-gram language model  .

    Exponential    

                               Maximum entropy   language models encode the relationship between a word and the ''n''-gram history using feature functions. The equation is

 math display  block   P w_m  mid w_1, ldots,w_ m-1      frac 1  Z w_1, ldots,w_ m-1     exp  a T f w_1, ldots,w_m    math 

where  math Z w_1, ldots,w_ m-1    math  is the                                    partition function  ,  math a  math  is the parameter vector, and  math f w_1, ldots,w_m   math  is the feature function. In the simplest case, the feature function is just an indicator of the presence of a certain ''n''-gram. It is helpful to use a prior on  math a  math  or some form of                                regularization  .

The log-bilinear model is another example of an exponential language model.

   Neural models   
    Recurrent neural network    
Continuous representations or                  embeddings of words   are produced in   recurrent neural network  -based language models  known also as ''continuous space language models'' .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Such continuous space embeddings help to alleviate the   curse of dimensionality  , which is the consequence of the number of possible sequences of words increasing                      exponentially   with the size of the vocabulary, furtherly causing a data sparsity problem. Neural networks avoid this problem by representing words as non-linear combinations of weights in a neural net.

  excerpt Large language model  

Although sometimes matching human performance, it is not clear whether they are plausible                   cognitive models  . At least for recurrent neural networks, it has been shown that they sometimes learn patterns that humans do not, but fail to learn patterns that humans typically do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

   Evaluation and benchmarks   

Evaluation of the quality of language models is mostly done by comparison to human created sample benchmarks created from typical language-oriented tasks. Other, less established, quality tests examine the intrinsic character of a language model or compare two such models. Since language models are typically intended to be dynamic and to learn from data they see, some proposed models investigate the rate of learning, e.g., through inspection of learning curves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Various data sets have been developed for use in evaluating language processing systems.
