'''Self-healing materials''' are a class of   smart material  s that have the structurally incorporated ability to repair damage caused by mechanical usage over time. The inspiration comes from biological systems, which have the ability to heal after being wounded. Initiation of cracks and other types of damage on a microscopic level has been shown to change   thermal  ,   electrical  , and   acoustical   properties, and eventually lead to whole scale failure of the material. Usually, cracks are mended by hand, which is unsatisfactory because cracks are often hard to detect. A material that can intrinsically correct damage caused by normal usage could lower costs of a number of different industrial processes through longer part lifetime, reduction of inefficiency over time caused by degradation, as well as prevent costs incurred by material failure.                      For a material to be strictly defined as self-healing, it is necessary that the healing process occurs without human intervention.  Some examples shown below, however, include healing polymers that require intervention to initiate the healing process.

   Polymer breakdown   

From a molecular perspective, traditional polymers yield to mechanical stress through cleavage of   sigma bond  s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      While newer polymers can yield in other ways, traditional polymers typically yield through                           homolytic   or   heterolytic bond cleavage  . The factors that determine how a polymer will yield include: type of stress, chemical properties inherent to the polymer, level and type of   solvation  , and temperature.                        

From a   macromolecular   perspective, stress induced damage at the molecular level leads to larger scale damage called microcracks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               A microcrack is formed where neighboring polymer chains have been damaged in close proximity, ultimately leading to the weakening of the fiber as a whole.                 

    Homolytic bond cleavage    
  File:HomolyticcleavageofPMMA.gif thumb 300 px '''Scheme 1.''' Homolytic cleavage of   poly methyl methacrylate     PMMA .  
Polymers have been observed to undergo homolytic bond cleavage through the use of                       radical   reporters such as   DPPH    2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl  and PMNB  pentamethylnitrosobenzene.  When a bond is cleaved homolytically, two radical species are formed which can recombine to repair damage or can initiate other homolytic cleavages which can in turn lead to more damage.                        

    Heterolytic bond cleavage    
  File:HeterolyticcleavageofPEG.gif thumb 300 px '''Scheme 2.''' Heterolytic cleavage of   polyethylene glycol  .  
Polymers have also been observed to undergo heterolytic bond cleavage through isotope labeling experiments. When a bond is cleaved heterolytically,   cationic   and   anionic   species are formed which can in turn recombine to repair damage, can be   quenched   by solvent, or can react destructively with nearby polymers.                        

    Reversible bond cleavage    
Certain polymers yield to mechanical stress in an atypical, reversible manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Diels-Alder  -based polymers undergo a reversible   cycloaddition  , where mechanical stress cleaves two   sigma bond  s in a retro   Diels-Alder   reaction. This stress results in additional pi-bonded electrons as opposed to radical or charged moieties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

   Supramolecular breakdown   

  Supramolecular     polymer  s are composed of monomers that interact   non-covalent  ly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Common interactions include   hydrogen bond  s, metal                        coordination  , and   van der Waals forces  .                  Mechanical stress in supramolecular polymers causes the disruption of these specific non-covalent interactions, leading to monomer separation and polymer breakdown.

  Reversible healing polymers  
Reversible systems are polymeric systems that can revert to the initial state whether it is   monomeric  ,   oligomeric  , or non-cross-linked. Since the   polymer   is stable under normal condition, the reversible process usually requires an external stimulus for it to occur. For a reversible healing polymer, if the material is damaged by means such as heating and reverted to its constituents, it can be repaired or  healed  to its   polymer   form by applying the original condition used to polymerize it.

   Covalently bonded system   

    Diels-Alder and retro-Diels-Alder    
Among the examples of reversible healing polymers, the   Diels-Alder    DA  reaction and its retro-  Diels-Alder    RDA  analogue seems to be very promising due to its thermal reversibility. In general, the   monomer   containing the functional groups such as   furan   or   maleimide   form two carbon-carbon bonds in a specific manner and construct the polymer through DA reaction. This polymer, upon heating, breaks down to its original monomeric units via RDA reaction and then reforms the   polymer   upon cooling or through any other conditions that were initially used to make the polymer. During the last few decades, two types of reversible   polymer  s have been studied:  i  polymers where the pendant groups, such as   furan   or   maleimide   groups, cross-link through successive DA coupling reactions;  ii  polymers where the multifunctional monomers link to each other through successive DA coupling reactions.                             

     Cross-linked polymers     

In this type of   polymer  , the polymer forms through the cross linking of the pendant groups from the linear   thermoplastics  . For example, Saegusa ''et al.'' have shown the reversible cross-linking of modified poly ''N''-acetylethyleneimine s containing either   maleimide   or furancarbonyl pendant moideties. The reaction is shown in Scheme 3. They mixed the two complementary   polymer  s to make a highly   cross-linked   material through DA reaction of furan and maleimide units at room temperature, as the   cross-linked     polymer   is more thermodynamically stable than the individual starting materials. However, upon heating the polymer to 80  C for two hours in a                     polar     solvent  , two   monomer  s were regenerated via RDA reaction, indicating the breaking of   polymer  s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This was possible because the heating energy provided enough energy to go over the energy barrier and results in the two   monomer  s. Cooling the two starting   monomer  s, or damaged   polymer  , to room temperature for 7 days healed and reformed the polymer.

The reversible DA RDA reaction is not limited to furan-meleimides based   polymer  s as it is shown by the work of Schiraldi ''et al.'' They have shown the reversible cross-linking of polymers bearing pendent   anthracene   group with maleimides. However, the reversible reaction occurred only partially upon heating to 250  C due to the competing   decomposition   reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

     Polymerization of multifunctional monomers     

In this type of polymer, the DA reaction takes place in the backbone itself to construct the polymer, not as a link. For polymerization and healing processes of a DA-step-growth   furan  -  maleimide   based polymer  3M4F  were demonstrated by subjecting it to heating cooling cycles. Tris-maleimide  3M  and tetra-furan  4F  formed a polymer through DA reaction and, when heated to 120  C, de-polymerized through RDA reaction, resulting in the starting materials. Subsequent heating to 90 120  C and cooling to room temperature healed the polymer, partially restoring its mechanical properties through intervention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The reaction is shown in Scheme 4.

    Thiol-based polymers    
The thiol-based polymers have   disulfide bonds   that can be reversibly cross-linked through   oxidation   and         reduction  . Under reducing condition, the   disulfide    SS  bridges in the polymer breaks and results in monomers, however, under oxidizing condition, the   thiols    SH  of each monomer forms the   disulfide bond  , cross-linking the starting materials to form the polymer. Chujo ''et al.'' have shown the   thiol  -based reversible cross-linked polymer using poly ''N''-acetylethyleneimine .

    Poly urea-urethane     
A soft poly urea-urethane  network leverages the metathesis reaction in aromatic disulphides to provide room-temperature self-healing properties, without the need for external catalysts. This chemical reaction is naturally able to create covalent bonds at room temperature, allowing the polymer to autonomously heal without an external source of energy. Left to rest at room temperature, the material mended itself with 80 percent efficiency after only two hours and 97 percent after 24 hours.  cn date February 2014  

In 2014 a polyurea   elastomer  -based material was shown to be self-healing, melding together after being cut in half, without the addition of catalysts or other chemicals. The material also include inexpensive commercially-available compounds. The elastomer molecules were tweaked, making the bonds between them longer. The resulting molecules are easier to pull apart from one another and better able to rebond at room temperature with almost the same strength. The rebonding can be repeated. Stretchy, self-healing paints and other coatings recently took a step closer to common use, thanks to research being conducted at the University of Illinois. Scientists there have used  off-the-shelf  components to create a polymer that melds back together after being cut in half, without the addition of catalysts or other chemicals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

  Autonomic polymer healing  
Self-healing   polymer  s follow a three-step process very similar to that of a biological response. In the event of damage, the first response is triggering or actuation, which happens almost immediately after damage is sustained. The second response is transport of materials to the effected area, which also happens very quickly. The third response is the chemical repair process. This process differs depending on the type of healing mechanism that is in place.  e.g.,   polymerization  , entanglement, reversible cross-linking . These self-healing materials can be classified in three different ways: capsule based, vascular, and intrinsic  which is listed as  Reversible healing polymers  above . While similar in some ways, these three ways differ in the ways that response is hidden or prevented until actual damage is sustained. Capsule based polymers sequester the healing agents in little capsules that only release the agents if they are ruptured. Vascular self-healing materials sequester the healing agent in capillary type hollow channels which can be interconnected one dimensionally, two dimensionally, or three dimensionally. After one of these capillaries is damaged, the network can be refilled by an outside source or another channel that was not damaged. Intrinsic self-healing materials, as you can see from above, do not have a sequestered healing agent but instead have a latent self-healing functionality that is triggered by damage or by an outside stimulus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Thus far, all of the examples on this page require an external stimulus to initiate   polymer   healing  such as heat or light . Energy is introduced into the system to allow repolymerization to take place. This is not possible for all materials.   Thermosetting polymer  s, for example, are not remoldable. Once they are polymerized                       cured   ,   decomposition   occurs before the melt temperature is reached. Thus, adding heat to initiate healing in the polymer is not possible. Additionally,   thermosetting polymer  s cannot be recycled, so it is even more important to extend the lifetime of materials of this nature.

   Hollow tube approach   
For the first method, fragile glass capillaries or fibers are imbedded within a   composite material  .  Note: this is already a commonly used practice for strengthening materials. See   Fiber-reinforced plastic  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The resulting porous network is filled with   monomer  . When damage occurs in the material from regular use, the tubes also crack and the monomer is released into the cracks. Other tubes containing a hardening agent also crack and mix with the   monomer  , causing the crack to be healed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are many things to take into account when introducing hollow tubes into a   crystalline structure  . First to consider is that the created channels may compromise the load bearing ability of the material due to the removal of load bearing material.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Also, the channel diameter, degree of branching, location of branch points, and channel orientation are some of the main things to consider when building up microchannels within a material. Materials that don t need to withstand much mechanical                           strain  , but want self-healing properties, can introduce more microchannels than materials that are meant to be load bearing.                                    There are two types of hollow tubes: discrete channels, and interconnected channels.                                   

    Discrete channels    

Discrete channels can be built independently of building the material and are placed in an array throughout the material.                                    When creating these microchannels, one major factor to take into account is that the closer the tubes are together, the lower the strength will be, but the more efficient the recovery will be.                                    A sandwich structure is a type of discrete channels that consists of tubes in the center of the material, and heals outwards from the middle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The stiffness of sandwich structures is high, making it an attractive option for   pressurized   chambers.                                For the most part in sandwich structures, the strength of the material is maintained as compared to vascular networks.  Also, material shows almost full recovery from damage.                               

    Interconnected networks    

Interconnected networks are more              efficient   than discrete channels, but are harder and more expensive to create.                                    The most basic way to create these channels is to apply basic machining principles to create micro scale channel grooves. These techniques yield channels from 600 700 micrometers.                                    This technique works great on the two-dimensional plane, but when trying to create a three-dimensional network, they are limited.                                   

    Direct Ink Writing    

The Direct Ink Writing  DIW  technique is a controlled extrusion of viscoelastic inks to create three-dimensional   interconnected   networks.                                    It works by first setting                    organic   ink in a defined pattern. Then the structure is infiltrated with a material like an   epoxy  . This epoxy is then   solidified  , and the ink can be sucked out with a modest vacuum, creating the hollow tubes.                                   

   Microcapsule healing   
This method is similar in design to the hollow tube approach. Monomer is encapsulated and embedded within the   thermosetting polymer  . When the crack reaches the microcapsule, the capsule breaks and the monomer bleeds into the crack, where it can polymerize and mend the crack

  File:polymerization in situ.jpg thumb 600 px  center '''Figure 1.''' Depiction of crack propagation through microcapsule-imbedded material. Monomer microcapsules are represented by pink circles and catalyst is shown by purple dots.  

A good way to enable multiple healing events is to use living  or unterminated chain-ends  polymerization catalysts. If the walls of the capsule are created too thick, they may not fracture when the crack approaches, but if they are too thin, they may rupture prematurely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

In order for this process to happen at room   temperature  , and for the reactants to remain in a monomeric state within the capsule, a   catalyst   is also imbedded into the thermoset. The catalyst lowers the   energy barrier   of the                     reaction   and allows the monomer to polymerize without the addition of heat. The capsules  often made of   wax    around the monomer and the catalyst are important maintain separation until the crack facilitates the reaction.                                                                    

There are many challenges in designing this type of material. First, the reactivity of the   catalyst   must be maintained even after it is enclosed in wax. Additionally, the monomer must flow at a sufficient rate  have low enough   viscosity    to cover the entire crack before it is polymerized, or full healing capacity will not be reached. Finally, the catalyst must quickly dissolve into monomer in order to react efficiently and prevent the crack from spreading further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  File:reaction for wiki page.png  thumb 300 px '''Scheme 6.''' ROMP of DCPD via   Grubbs' catalyst    
This process has been demonstrated with   dicyclopentadiene    DCPD  and   Grubbs' catalyst    benzylidene-bis tricyclohexylphosphine dichlororuthenium . Both DCPD and   Grubbs' catalyst   are imbedded in an   epoxy     resin  . The   monomer   on its own is relatively unreactive and   polymerization   does not take place. When a microcrack reaches both the capsule containing DCPD and the   catalyst  , the   monomer   is released from the core shell microcapsule and comes in contact with exposed catalyst, upon which the monomer undergoes   ring opening metathesis polymerization    ROMP .                                        The                       metathesis   reaction of the   monomer   involves the severance of the two double bonds in favor of new bonds.  The presence of the   catalyst   allows for the   energy barrier    energy of activation  to be lowered, and the polymerization                     reaction   can proceed at room temperature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The resulting   polymer   allows the   epoxy     composite material   to regain 67  of its former strength.

  Grubbs' catalyst   is a good choice for this type of system because it is insensitive to air and water, thus robust enough to maintain reactivity within the material. Using a live catalyst is important to promote multiple healing actions.                      The major drawback is the cost. It was shown that using more of the catalyst corresponded directly to higher degree of healing.   Ruthenium   is quite costly, which makes it impractical for commercial applications.

   Carbon nanotube networks   
Through dissolving a linear   polymer   inside a solid three-dimensional   epoxy   matrix, so that they are miscible to each other, the linear polymer becomes mobile at a certain   temperature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      When   carbon nanotube  s are also incorporated into epoxy material, and a   direct current   is run through the tubes, a significant shift in sensing curve indicates permanent damage to the   polymer  , thus  sensing  a crack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           When the   carbon nanotube  s sense a crack within the   structure  , they can be used as thermal transports to heat up the matrix so the linear   polymer  s can diffuse to fill the cracks in the epoxy matrix. Thus healing the material.                            

   SLIPS   
A different approach was suggested by Prof. J. Aizenberg from Harvard University, who suggested to use Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces  SLIPS , a porous material inspired by the carnivorous pitcher plant and filled with a lubricating liquid immiscible with both water and oil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   SLIPS possess self-healing and self-lubricating properties as well as icephobicity and were successfully used for many purposes.

  Self-healing in polymers and fibre-reinforced polymer composites  

   Catalytic liquid-based healing agents   

Completely autonomous synthetic self-healing material was reported in 2001 on example of an   epoxy   system containing                       microcapsules  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               These microcapsules were filled with a  liquid    monomer  . If a   microcrack   occurs in this system, the microcapsule will rupture and the monomer will fill the crack. Subsequently it will                  polymerise  , initiated by   catalyst   particles                     Grubbs   catalyst  that are also dispersed through the system. This model system of a self healing particle proved to work very well in pure polymers and polymer coatings.

A hollow glass fibre approach may be more appropriate for self-healing impact damage in fibre-reinforced polymer composite materials. Impact damage can cause a significant reduction in compressive strength with little damage obvious to the naked eye. Hollow glass fibres containing liquid healing agents  some fibres carrying a liquid epoxy monomer and some the corresponding liquid hardener  are embedded within a composite laminate. Studies have shown significant potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

   Thermal solid-state healing agents   

 Intrinsically  self-healing materials such as   supramolecular polymer  s are formed by reversibly connected non-  covalent bond  s  i.e.   hydrogen bond   , which will disassociate at elevated temperatures. Healing of these supramolecullary based materials is accomplished by heating them and allowing the non-covalent bonds to break. Upon cooling, new bonds form and the material heals any damage. An advantage of this method is that no reactive chemicals or  toxic  catalysts are needed. However, these materials are not  autonomic  as they require the intervention of an outside agent to initiate a healing response.

   Non-catalytic, non-thermal agents   

A poly urea urethane  elastomeric network can spontaneously achieve healing in the absence of a catalyst. It is the metathesis reaction of aromatic disulphided  which naturally exchange at room temperature  that causes regeneration. It displayed 97  healing efficiency in just two hours and does not break when stretched manually. The tested poly urea urethane  composite is relatively soft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

   Biomimetics   
Self-healing materials are widely encountered in natural systems, and inspiration can be drawn from these systems for design. There is evidence in the academic literature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        of these              biomimetic   design approaches being used in the development of self-healing systems for polymer composites.                                                                                                                                                                                                              In biology, for the minimum power to pump fluid through vessels   Murray's law   applies. Deviation from Murray s law is small however, increasing the diameter 10  only leads to an additional power requirement of 3  5 . Murray s law is followed in some mechanical vessels, and using Murray s law can reduce the hydraulic resistance throughout the vessels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The DIW structure from above can be used to essentially mimic the structure of skin. Toohey ''et al.'' did this with an   epoxy   substrate containing a grid of microchannels containing   dicyclopentadiene    DCPD , and incorporated   Grubbs' catalyst   to the surface. This showed partial recovery of toughness after fracture, and could be repeated several times because of the ability to replenish the channels after use. The process is not repeatable forever, because the   polymer   in the crack plane from previous healings would build up over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

  Further applications  
Self-healing epoxies can be incorporated on to metals in order to prevent corrosion.
A substrate metal showed major degradation and rust formation after 72 hours of exposure. But after being coated with the self-healing epoxy, there was no visible damage under SEM after 72 hours of same exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

  History  
Self healing materials only emerged as a widely recognized field of study in the 21st century. The first international conference on self-healing materials was held in 2007.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The field of self-healing materials is related to   biomimetic   materials  materials inspired by living nature  as well as to other novel materials and surfaces with the embedded capacity for self-organization, such as the self-lubricating and   self-cleaning   materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

However, some of the simpler applications have been known for centuries, such as the self repair of cracks in concrete. Related processes in concrete have been studied microscopically since the 19th century.  A form of                          self healing mortar   was known even to the                ancient Romans  .                                            

  Commercialization  
At least one company is attempting to bring the newer applications of self healing material to the market. As of 2012, Autonomic Materials Inc., had raised over three million US dollars.
