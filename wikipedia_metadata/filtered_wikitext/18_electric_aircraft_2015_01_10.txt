An '''electric aircraft''' is an   aircraft   that runs on   electric motor  s rather than   internal combustion engine  s, with   electricity   coming from   fuel cell  s,   solar cell  s,   ultracapacitors  ,   power beaming  ,                                                                                           or                         batteries  .

Currently flying electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators, including manned and   unmanned aerial vehicle  s.                                 Electrically powered model aircraft   have been flown since the 1970s, with one report in 1957.                   The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973.                  

  History  
In 1883,   Gaston Tissandier   was the first to use electric motors in   airship   propulsion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The following year,   Charles Renard   and                           Arthur Krebs   flew                       La France   with a more powerful motor.                     

Electric motors have been used for model fixed-wing aircraft since from at least 1957, with a challenged claim from 1909.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

In 1964,   William C. Brown   demonstrates on CBS News with Walter Cronkite a model helicopter that receives all of the power needed for flight from a microwave beam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

In 1973,   Fred Militky   and   Heino Brditschka   converted a   Brditschka HB-3     motor glider   to an electric aircraft, the   Militky MB-E1  , the first man carrying, full size aircraft to fly under solely under electric power. Heino flew it for 14 minutes that same year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

In 2007, the non-profit   CAFE Foundation   held the first Electric Aircraft Symposium in San Francisco.                                                                                                                                  
The first electric registered aircraft makes its first flights the 2007-12-23 : BL1E  Electra   F-PMDJ .                                                                                                                                             

In 2009, a team from the Turin Polytechnic University made a conversion of a Pioneer Alpi 300. It flew 250 nbsp;km h for 14 minutes.                                                                                                      

By 2011, the use of electric power for aircraft was gaining momentum. At   AirVenture   in that year the ''Electric Aircraft World Symposium'' was held and attracted wide attention. It was sponsored by   GE Aviation   and included presentations by   US Air Force  ,   NASA  ,   Sikorsky Aircraft  , Argonne National Labs and the US   Federal Aviation Administration  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

  Experimental projects  

   1970s and 1980s   

    Militky MB-E1    
In 1973 the                West German     Militky MB-E1   became the first man-carrying, full-size aircraft to fly solely on electric power. It used Ni-Cd batteries and a   convert 10 kW hp abbr on   DC motor, which gave it a duration of over 12 minutes.                  

    Sunrise    
The   convert 27 lb kg 0 abbr on   unmanned   AstroFlight Sunrise  , the result of an ARPA contract, made the world's first solar-powered flight from Bicycle Lake, a dry lakebed on the   Fort Irwin Military Reservation  , on 4 November 1974. The improved Sunrise II flew on 27 September 1975 at   Nellis Air Force Base  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

    Solar Riser    
The world s first official flight in a solar-powered, man-carrying aircraft took place on April 29, 1979. The   Mauro Solar Riser   was built by   Larry Mauro   and was based on the   UFM Easy Riser   biplane   hang glider  . The aircraft used photovoltaic cells that produced 350 watts at 30 volts, which charged a   Hughes 500   helicopter battery, which in turn powered the electric motor. The aircraft was capable of powering the motor for 3 to 5 minutes, following a 1.5-hour charge, enabling it to reach a gliding altitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

    Solar One    
The   Solar-Powered Aircraft Developments Solar One   was designed by David Williams under the direction of Freddie To, an architect and member of the   Kremer prize   committee and produced by   Solar-Powered Aircraft Developments  . A motor-glider type aircraft originally built as a pedal-powered airplane to attempt the Channel crossing, the airplane proved too heavy to be successfully powered by human power and was then converted to solar power,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      using an electric motor driven by batteries that were charged before flight by a solar cell array on the wing.                                                                                                                                                                                                             The maiden flight of Solar One took place at Lasham Airfield; Hampshire on June 13, 1979.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

    Gossamer Penguin and Solar Challenger    
The   Gossamer Penguin  , a smaller version of the human-powered   Gossamer Albatross   was completely solar-powered. A second prototype, the   Solar Challenger  , flew   convert 262 km mi abbr on   from Paris to England.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          On 7 July 1981, the aircraft, under solar-power, flew 163 miles from Cormeilles-en-Vexin Airport near   Paris   across the   English Channel   to   RAF Manston   near   London  , flying for 5 hours and 23 minutes. Designed by Dr.   Paul MacCready   the Solar Challenger set an altitude record of 14,300 feet.

The aircraft used an electrical motor along with batteries which were charged by the pedalling action of an athlete piloting the aircraft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

    Aerovironment Bionic Bat    
The   Aerovironment   Bionic Bat was an aircraft built to compete for the Kremer Speed Challenge, one in a series of   Kremer prize   offerings administered by the   Royal Aeronautical Society  . It incorporated an electric motor that doubled as a generator while on the ground, with the pilot's pedaling action charging ni-cad batteries. The stored energy was used to supplement pedal power from the pilot during record attempts. In 1984, Bionic Bat won two segments of the Kremer Speed Challenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

    Solair 1    
The human piloted Solair 1 was developed by Günther Rochelt and based on a   Hans Farner                          canard   design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It employed 2499 wing-mounted solar cells, giving an output of between 1.8   kilowatts    kW . This was equivalent to approximately 2.4   horsepower    hp , and   convert 2.2 kW hp 1 abbr on  . The aircraft first flew at   Unterwössen  ,   Germany   on 21 August 1983.                   It flew for 5 hours and 41 minutes,  mostly on solar energy and also thermals .                   The aircraft is now displayed at the German Museum in   Munich  .                      The newly developed piloted Solair II made its first flight in May 1998 and further test flights that summer but the propulsion system overheated too fast.                      Development stopped when Günther Rochelt suddenly died in September 1998.

    Sunseeker    
During the summer of 1990, the solar-powered airplane ''Sunseeker'', piloted by                      Eric Raymond  , became the first solar-powered airplane to cross the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                It used a small battery pack charged by solar cells on the wings for takeoff, and then was able to fly directly on solar power.                                                                                                                                                                                     

The ''Sunseeker II'', built in 2002, was updated in 2005 2006 with a more powerful motor, larger wing, lithium battery packs and updated control electronics.                                                                                                                                    As of Dec, 2008 it was the only manned solar-powered airplane in flying condition and was flown regularly by Solar Flight.                         In 2009 it became the first solar-powered aircraft to cross the   Alps  , 99 years after the first crossing of the Alps by an aircraft.

    Antares 20E and 23E    
The   Antares 20E   is an electric, self-launching 20-meter   sailplane   with a 42-  kW   DC DC brushless motor and                       lithium-ion batteries  . It can climb up to 3,000 meters with fully charged cells.                                                                                                                                                The first flight was in 2003. The Antares 20E was the first aircraft with an electric propulsion system to obtain a certificate of airworthiness. In 2011 the aircraft won the 2011 Berblinger competition,                                                                                                                                 an ambitious aerial challenge for  green  aircraft. The   Antares 23E   is a 23-meter version of the 20E featuring a wider range of wing-loading and higher performance, using the same propulsion system as the 20E and Arcus E. The   Antares 23E   first flew in December 2011, with series production commencing in early 2012.                                     

    Alan Cocconi and the SoLong    
In 2005,   Alan Cocconi  , who founded the California  USA  electric-propulsion research company   AC Propulsion  , flew, with the assistance of several other pilots, an unmanned airplane named  SoLong  for 48 hours non-stop, propelled entirely by solar energy. This was the first such around-the-clock flight, on energy stored in the batteries mounted on the plane.
