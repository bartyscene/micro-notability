As a   medication  , '''insulin''' is any   pharmaceutical   preparation of the protein hormone   insulin   that is used to treat   high blood glucose  .                        Such conditions include   type 1 diabetes  ,   type 2 diabetes  ,   gestational diabetes  , and complications of   diabetes   such as   diabetic ketoacidosis   and   hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states  .                        Insulin is also used along with   glucose   to treat   hyperkalemia    high blood potassium levels .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Typically it is given by   injection under the skin  , but some forms may also be used by   injection into a vein   or                           muscle  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are various types of insulin, suitable for various time spans. The types are often all called ''insulin'' in the broad              sense  , although in a more precise sense, insulin is identical to the naturally occurring molecule whereas   insulin analog  ues have slightly different molecules that allow for modified time of action. It is on the                                         World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In 2022, it was the 192nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2  nbsp  million prescriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

                                   
Insulin can be made from the   pancreas   of pigs or cows.                     Human versions can be made either by modifying pig versions, or   recombinant technology                       using mainly ''  E. coli  '' or                            ''Saccharomyces'' ''cerevisiae''  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It comes in three main types: short acting  such as   regular insulin   , intermediate-acting  such as               neutral protamine Hagedorn    NPH  insulin , and longer-acting  such as   insulin glargine   .

Insulin is used to treat a number of diseases including   diabetes   and its acute complications such as   diabetic ketoacidosis   and   hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states  . It is also used along with   glucose   to treat                high blood potassium levels  . Use during   pregnancy   is relatively safe for the baby.                        Insulin was formerly used in a psychiatric treatment called   insulin shock therapy  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

   Side effects   
Some side effects are   hypoglycemia    low blood sugar ,   hypokalemia    low blood potassium , and   allergic reactions  .                        Allergy to insulin affected about 2  of people, of which most reactions are not due to the insulin itself but to preservatives added to insulin such as zinc,   protamine  , and   meta-cresol  . Most reactions are   Type I hypersensitivity   reactions and rarely cause   anaphylaxis  . A suspected allergy to insulin can be confirmed by   skin prick testing  ,   patch testing   and occasionally   skin biopsy  . First line therapy against insulin hypersensitivity reactions include symptomatic therapy with antihistamines. The affected persons are then switched to a preparation that does not contain the specific agent they are reacting to or undergo                              desensitization  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

'''Cutaneous adverse effects'''

Other side effects may include pain or skin changes at the sites of injection. Repeated subcutaneous injection without site rotation can lead to   lipohypertrophy   and amyloidomas, which manifest as firm palpable nodules under the skin.

Early initiation of insulin therapy for the long-term management of conditions such as type 2 diabetes would suggest that the use of insulin has unique benefits, however, with insulin therapy, there is a need to gradually raise the dose and the complexity of the regimen, as well as the likelihood of developing severe hypoglycemia which is why many people and their doctors are hesitant to begin insulin therapy in the early stage of disease management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Many obstacles associated with health behaviors also prevent people with type 2 diabetes mellitus from starting or intensifying their insulin treatment, including lack of motivation, lack of familiarity with or experience with treatments, and time restraints causing people to have high glycemic loads for extended periods of time prior to starting insulin therapy. This is why managing the side effects associated with long-term early routine use of insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus can prove to be a therapeutic and behavioral challenge.

Insulin is an                      endogenous     hormone  , which is produced by the   pancreas  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
The insulin   protein   has been highly conserved across evolutionary time, and is present in both   mammals   and   invertebrates  . The insulin   insulin-like growth factor   signalling pathway  IIS  has been extensively studied in species including nematode worms  e.g.''                         C. elegans  '' , flies  ''  Drosophila melanogaster  ''  and mice  ''  Mus musculus  '' . Its mechanisms of action are highly similar across species.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

Both   type 1 diabetes   and   type 2 diabetes   are marked by a loss of pancreatic function, though to differing degrees.                     People who are affected with diabetes are referred to as diabetics. Many diabetics require an exogenous source of insulin to keep their blood sugar levels within a safe target range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

In 1916, Nicolae C. Paulescu  1869 1931  succeeded in developing an aqueous pancreatic extract that normalized a diabetic dog. In 1921, he published 4 papers in the Society of Biology in Paris centering on the successful effects of the pancreatic extract in diabetic dogs. Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation by Paulescu was published in August 1921 in the Archives Internationales de Physiologie, Li√®ge, Belgium. Initially, the only way to obtain insulin for clinical use was to extract it from the pancreas of another creature. Animal glands were obtainable as a waste product of the meatpacking industry. Insulin was derived primarily from   cows      Eli Lilly and Company    and   pigs      Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium   . The making of eight ounces of purified insulin could require as much as two tons of pig parts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Insulin from these sources is effective in humans as it is highly similar to human insulin  three amino acid difference in bovine insulin, one amino acid difference in porcine .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Initially, lower preparation purity resulted in allergic reactions to the presence of non-insulin substances. Purity has improved steadily since the 1920s ultimately reaching purity of 99  by the mid-1970s thanks to   high-pressure liquid chromatography    HPLC  methods. Minor allergic reactions still occur occasionally, even to synthetic  human  insulin varieties.                     

Beginning in 1982, biosynthetic  human  insulin has been manufactured for clinical use through genetic engineering techniques using                                                          recombinant DNA   technology.   Genentech   developed the technique used to produce the first such insulin, Humulin, but did not commercially market the product themselves.                         Eli Lilly   marketed Humulin in 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Humulin was the first medication produced using modern genetic engineering techniques in which actual human DNA is inserted into a host cell  ''  E. coli  '' in this case . The host cells are then allowed to grow and reproduce normally, and due to the inserted human DNA, they produce a synthetic version of human insulin. Manufacturers claim this reduces the presence of many impurities. However, the clinical preparations prepared from such insulins differ from endogenous human insulin in several important respects; an example is the absence of   C-peptide   which has in recent years been shown to have systemic effects itself.
  Novo Nordisk   has also developed a genetically engineered insulin independently using a yeast process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

According to a survey that the International Diabetes Federation conducted in 2002 on the access to and availability of insulin in its member countries, approximately 70  of the insulin that is currently sold in the world is recombinant, biosynthetic 'human' insulin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A majority of insulin used clinically today is produced this way, although clinical experience has provided conflicting evidence on whether these insulins are any less likely to produce an allergic reaction. Adverse reactions have been reported; these include loss of warning signs that patients may slip into a coma through   hypoglycemia  , convulsions, memory lapse and loss of concentration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     However, the International Diabetes Federation's position statement from 2005 is very clear in stating that  there is NO overwhelming evidence to prefer one species of insulin over another  and   modern, highly purified  animal insulins remain a perfectly acceptable alternative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Since January 2006, all insulins distributed in the US and some other countries are synthetic  human  insulins or their analogues. A special FDA importation process is required to obtain bovine or porcine derived insulin for use in the US,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           although there may be some remaining stocks of porcine insulin made by Lilly in 2005 or earlier, and porcine   lente insulin   is also sold and marketed under the brand name Vetsulin SM  in the US for veterinary usage in the treatment of companion animals with diabetes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

    Basal insulin    
In type 1 diabetes, insulin production is extremely low, and as such the body requires   exogenous   insulin. Some people with type 2 diabetes, particularly those with very high                       hemoglobin A1c   values, may also require a baseline rate of insulin, as their body is desensitized to the level of insulin being produced. Basal insulin regulates the body's blood glucose between mealtimes, as well as overnight. This basal rate of insulin action is generally achieved via the use of an intermediate-acting insulin  such as NPH  or a long-acting insulin analog. In type 1 diabetics, it may also be achieved via continuous infusion of rapid-acting insulin using an   insulin pump  . Approximately half of a person's daily insulin requirement is administered as a basal insulin, usually administered once per day at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

    Prandial insulin    
When a person eats food containing carbohydrates and glucose, insulin helps regulate the body's metabolism of the food. Prandial insulin, also called mealtime or bolus insulin, is designed as a                    bolus   dose of insulin prior to a meal to regulate the spike in blood glucose that occurs following a meal. The dose of prandial insulin may be static, or may be calculated by the patient using either their current blood sugar, planned carbohydrate intake, or both. This calculation may also be performed by an insulin pump in patients using a pump. Insulin regiments that consist of doses calculated in this manner are considered                             intensive insulin regimens  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Prandial insulin is usually administered no more than 15 30 minutes prior to a meal using a rapid-acting insulin or a regular insulin. In some patients, a combination insulin may be used that contains both NPH  long acting  insulin and a rapid regular insulin to provide both a basal insulin and prandial insulin.                        

   Challenges in treatment   
There are several challenges involved in the use of insulin as a clinical treatment for diabetes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  Mode of administration.
  Selecting the 'right' dose and timing. The amount of carbohydrates one unit of insulin handles varies widely between persons and over the day but values between 7 and 20 grams per 1 IE is typical.
  Selecting an appropriate insulin preparation  typically on 'speed of onset and duration of action' grounds .
  Adjusting dosage and timing to fit food intake timing, amounts, and types.
  Adjusting dosage and timing to fit exercise undertaken.
  Adjusting dosage, type, and timing to fit other conditions, for instance the increased stress of illness.
  Variability in absorption into the bloodstream via subcutaneous delivery
  The dosage is non-physiological in that a subcutaneous                    bolus   dose of insulin alone is administered instead of combination of insulin and   C-peptide   being released gradually and directly into the   portal vein  .
  It is simply a nuisance for people to inject whenever they eat carbohydrate or have a high blood glucose reading.
  It is dangerous in case of mistake  such as 'too much' insulin .

   Types   
Medical preparations of insulin are never just insulin in water  with nothing else . Clinical insulins are mixtures of insulin plus other substances including preservatives. These prevent the protein from spoiling or                               denaturing   too rapidly, delay absorption of the insulin, adjust the pH of the solution to reduce reactions at the injection site, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

Slight variations of the human insulin molecule are called   insulin analog  ues,  technically  insulin receptor   ligand  s   so named because they are not technically insulin, rather they are analogues which retain the hormone's glucose management functionality. They have absorption and activity characteristics not currently possible with subcutaneously injected insulin proper. They are either absorbed rapidly in an attempt to mimic real beta cell insulin  as with   insulin lispro  ,   insulin aspart  , and   insulin glulisine   , or steadily absorbed after injection instead of having a 'peak' followed by a more or less rapid decline in insulin action  as with   insulin detemir   and   insulin glargine   , all while retaining insulin's glucose-lowering action in the human body. However, a number of                 meta-analyses  , including those done by the   Cochrane Collaboration   in 2005,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Germany's Institute for Quality and Cost Effectiveness in the Health Care Sector  IQWiG  released in 2007,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health  CADTH                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       also released in 2007 have shown no unequivocal advantages in clinical use of insulin analogues over more conventional insulin types.                                  

The commonly used types of insulin are as follows.                    

    Fast-acting  Rapid-acting     
  See also Insulin analog  
Includes the insulin analogues                  ''aspart''  ,                  ''lispro''  , and                     ''glulisine''  . These begin to work within 5 to 15 minutes and are active for 3 to 4 hours. Most insulins form   hexamer  s, which delay entry into the blood in active form; these analog insulins do not but have normal insulin activity.

   Methods of administration   
  File:Insulin Delivery Devices.png thumb Insulin delivery devices  

Unlike many medicines, insulin cannot be taken orally at the present time. Like nearly all other proteins introduced into the   gastrointestinal tract  , it is reduced to fragments  single amino acid components , whereupon all activity is lost. There has been some research into ways to protect insulin from the digestive tract, so that it can be administered in a pill. So far this is entirely experimental.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

    Subcutaneous    
Insulin is usually taken as   subcutaneous injection  s by single-use   syringe  s with                     needles  , an   insulin pump  , or by repeated-use   insulin pen  s with needles. People who wish to reduce repeated skin puncture of insulin injections often use an   injection port   in conjunction with syringes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

The use of subcutaneous injections of insulin is designed to mimic the natural physiological cycle of insulin secretion, while taking into account the various properties of the formulations used such as half-life, onset of action, and duration of action. In many people, both a rapid- or short-acting insulin product as well as an intermediate- or long-acting product are used to decrease the amount of injections per day. In some, insulin injections may be combined with other injection therapy such as   GLP-1 receptor agonist  s. Cleansing of the injection site and injection technique are required to ensure effective insulin therapy.                        

    Insulin pump    
  Main Insulin pump  

  Insulin pump  s are a reasonable solution for some. Advantages to the person are better control over background or                    basal   insulin dosage, bolus doses calculated to fractions of a unit, and calculators in the pump that may help with determining                    bolus   infusion dosages. The limitations are cost, the potential for hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes, catheter problems, and no  closed loop  means of controlling insulin delivery based on current blood glucose levels.                                       

Insulin pumps may be like 'electrical injectors' attached to a temporarily implanted   catheter   or   cannula  . Some who cannot achieve adequate glucose control by conventional  or jet  injection are able to do so with the appropriate pump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Indwelling catheters pose the risk of infection and ulceration, and some peoples may also develop   lipodystrophy   due to the infusion sets. These risks can often be minimized by keeping infusion sites clean. Insulin pumps require care and effort to use correctly.

One                       international unit   of insulin  1 IU  is defined as the  biological equivalent  of 34.7             Œºg   pure crystalline insulin.  cn date September 2024  

The first definition of a unit of insulin was the amount required to induce   hypoglycemia   in a rabbit. This was set by   James Collip   at the University of Toronto in 1922. Of course, this was dependent on the size and diet of the rabbits. The unit of insulin was set by the insulin committee at the University of Toronto.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The unit evolved eventually to the old                              USP   insulin unit, where one unit  U  of insulin was set equal to the amount of insulin required to reduce the concentration of               blood glucose   in a   fasting     rabbit   to 45          m          g           d           L    2.5          m                 mol           L   . Once the chemical structure and mass of insulin was known, the unit of insulin was defined by the mass of pure crystalline insulin required to obtain the USP unit.  cn date September 2024  

The                        unit of measurement   used in insulin therapy is not part of the   International System of Units    abbreviated SI  which is the modern form of the   metric system  . Instead the                pharmacological                         international unit    IU  is defined by the   WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

    Potential complications    
  File:Insulin basal bolus.png thumb Diagram explaining the basal-bolus insulin schedule. The long acting insulin is given once  usually   glargine  , Lantus  or twice  usually   detemir  , Levemir  daily to provide a base, or basal insulin level. Rapid acting  RA  insulin is given before meals and snacks. A similar profile can be provided using an   insulin pump   where rapid acting insulin is given as the basal and premeal bolus insulin.  
The central problem for those requiring external insulin is picking the right dose of insulin and the right timing.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Physiological regulation of blood glucose, as in the non-diabetic, would be best. Increased blood glucose levels after a meal is a stimulus for prompt release of insulin from the pancreas. The increased insulin level causes glucose absorption and storage in cells, reduces glycogen to glucose conversion, reducing blood glucose levels, and so reducing insulin release. The result is that the blood glucose level rises somewhat after eating, and within an hour or so, returns to the normal 'fasting' level. Even the best diabetic treatment with synthetic human insulin or even insulin analogs, however administered, falls far short of normal glucose control in the non-diabetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Complicating matters is that the composition of the food eaten  see ''  glycemic index  ''  affects intestinal absorption rates. Glucose from some foods is absorbed more  or less  rapidly than the same amount of glucose in other foods. In addition, fats and proteins cause delays in absorption of glucose from carbohydrates eaten at the same time. As well, exercise reduces the need for insulin even when all other factors remain the same, since working muscle has some ability to take up glucose without the help of insulin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

Because of the complex and interacting factors, it is, in principle, impossible to know for certain how much insulin  and which type  is needed to 'cover' a particular meal to achieve a reasonable blood glucose level within an hour or two after eating. Non-diabetics' beta cells routinely and automatically manage this by continual glucose level monitoring and insulin release. All such decisions by a diabetic must be based on experience and training  i.e., at the direction of a physician, PA, or in some places a specialist diabetic educator  and, further, specifically based on the individual experience of the person. But it is not straightforward and should never be done by habit or routine. With some care however, it can be done reasonably well in clinical practice. For example, some people with diabetes require more insulin after drinking   skim milk   than they do after taking an equivalent amount of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and fluid in some other form. Their particular reaction to skimmed milk is different from other people with diabetes, but the same amount of whole milk is likely to cause a still different reaction even in that person. Whole milk contains considerable fat while skimmed milk has much less. It is a continual balancing act for all people with diabetes, especially for those taking insulin.  cn date September 2024  

People with insulin-dependent diabetes typically require some base level of insulin  basal insulin , as well as short-acting insulin to cover meals  bolus also known as mealtime or   prandial   insulin . Maintaining the basal rate and the bolus rate is a continuous balancing act that people with insulin-dependent diabetes must manage each day. This is normally achieved through regular blood tests, although continuous blood sugar testing equipment    Continuous Glucose Monitor  s or CGMs  are now becoming available which could help to refine this balancing act once widespread usage becomes common.  cn date September 2024  

    Strategies    
A long-acting insulin is used to approximate the basal secretion of insulin by the pancreas, which varies in the course of the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             NPH isophane, lente, ultralente, glargine, and detemir may be used for this purpose. The advantage of NPH is its low cost, the fact that you can mix it with short-acting forms of insulin, thereby minimizing the number of injections that must be administered, and that the activity of NPH will peak 4 6 hours after administration, allowing a bedtime dose to balance the                   tendency of glucose to rise with the dawn  , along with a smaller morning dose to balance the lower afternoon basal need and possibly an afternoon dose to cover evening need. A disadvantage of bedtime NPH is that if not taken late enough  near midnight  to place its peak shortly before dawn, it has the potential of causing hypoglycemia. One theoretical advantage of glargine and detemir is that they only need to be administered once a day, although in practice many people find that neither lasts a full 24 hours. They can be administered at any time during the day as well, provided that they are given at the same time every day. Another advantage of long-acting insulins is that the basal component of an insulin regimen  providing a minimum level of insulin throughout the day  can be decoupled from the prandial or bolus component  providing mealtime coverage via ultra-short-acting insulins , while regimens using NPH and regular insulin have the disadvantage that any dose adjustment affects both basal and prandial coverage. Glargine and detemir are significantly more expensive than NPH, lente and ultralente, and they cannot be mixed with other forms of insulin.                                    

A short-acting insulin is used to simulate the endogenous insulin surge produced in anticipation of eating. Regular insulin, lispro, aspart and glulisine can be used for this purpose. Regular insulin should be given with about a 30-minute lead-time prior to the meal to be maximally effective and to minimize the possibility of hypoglycemia. Lispro, aspart and glulisine are approved for dosage with the first bite of the meal, and may even be effective if given after completing the meal. The short-acting insulin is also used to correct hyperglycemia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

     Sliding scales     
First described in 1934,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      what physicians typically refer to as sliding-scale insulin  SSI  is fast- or rapid-acting insulin only, given subcutaneously, typically at meal times and sometimes bedtime,                      but only when blood glucose is above a threshold  e.g. 10 nbsp;mmol L, 180 nbsp;mg dL .

   Insulin Medication in Pregnancy   

During pregnancy, spontaneous hyperglycemia can develop and lead to                        gestational diabetes mellitus  GDM   , a frequent pregnancy complication . With a prevalence of 6-20  among pregnant women globally, gestational diabetes mellitus  GDM  is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance developing or initially recognized during pregnancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Neutral protamine Hagedorn    NPH  insulin has been the cornerstone of insulin therapy during pregnancy, administered two to four times per day. Women with GDM and pregnant women with type I diabetes mellitus who frequently check their blood glucose levels and utilize glucose monitoring equipment for doing so, use continuous insulin infusion of a rapid-acting insulin analogue, such as                  lispro   and                  aspart.   However, a number of considerations go into choosing a regimen for administering insulin to patients. When managing GDM in pregnant women, these guidelines are crucial and can vary depending on certain physiological and interestingly the sociocultural environment as well. The current perinatal guidelines recommend a low daily dose of insulin and take into account the woman's physiological features and the frequency of self-monitoring. The importance of using specialized insulin therapy planning based on parameters like those stated above rather than a broad approach is emphasized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Women with pre-existing diabetes have the highest levels of insulin sensitivity early in pregnancy. Close glucose monitoring is required to prevent hypoglycemia, which can potentially result in altered consciousness, seizures, and maternal damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Low birth weight newborns might also be the result of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes, because they are frequently more insulin sensitive than persons with type 2 diabetes and more likely to be unaware of their hypoglycemic state. Close glucose monitoring is essential because after 16 weeks of pregnancy, women with preexisting diabetes become more insulin resistant and their insulin demands may fluctuate weekly. The need for insulin may rise from one pregnancy to the next. Therefore, it is realistic to expect higher needs for glucose control with subsequent pregnancies in multiparous women.                               

   As a performance-enhancing drug   
The possibility of using insulin in an attempt to improve athletic performance was suggested as early as the   1998 Winter Olympics   in                 Nagano, Japan  , as reported by   Peter S√∂nksen   in the July 2001 issue of ''  Journal of Endocrinology  ''. The question of whether non-diabetic athletes could legally use insulin was raised by a Russian medical officer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Whether insulin would actually improve athletic performance is unclear, but concerns about its use led the International Olympic Committee to ban use of the hormone by non-diabetic athletes in 1998.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

The book ''  Game of Shadows  ''  2001 , by reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, included allegations that baseball player   Barry Bonds   used insulin  as well as other drugs  in the apparent belief that it would increase the effectiveness of the growth hormone he was alleged to be taking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Bonds eventually testified in front of a federal grand jury as part of a government investigation of   BALCO  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Bodybuilders in particular are claimed to be using exogenous insulin and other drugs in the belief that they will increase muscle mass. Bodybuilders have been described as injecting up to 10                      IU   of regular synthetic insulin before eating sugary meals.                    
A 2008 report suggested that insulin is sometimes used in combination with   anabolic steroids   and   growth hormone    GH , and that  Athletes are exposing themselves to potential harm by self administering large doses of GH, IGF I and insulin .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Insulin abuse has been mentioned as a possible factor in the deaths of bodybuilders Ghent Wakefield and   Rich Piana  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Insulin, human growth hormone  HGH  and insulin-like growth factor 1  IGF-1  are self-administered by those looking to increase muscle mass beyond the scope offered by anabolic steroids alone. Their rationale is that since insulin and HGH act synergistically to promote growth, and since IGF-1 is a primary mediator of musculoskeletal growth, the 'stacking' of insulin, HGH and IGF-1 should offer a synergistic growth effect on skeletal muscle. This theory has been supported in recent years by top-level bodybuilders whose competition weight is in excess of   convert 50 lb abbr on   of muscle, larger than that of competitors in the past, and with even lower levels of body fat.                                     

    Insulin effects on strength, and exercise performance    
Exogenous insulin significantly boosts the rate of glucose metabolism in training athletes along with a substantial increase in the peak           V O2  .                  Insulin is thought to enhance performance by increasing protein synthesis, reducing protein catabolism, and facilitating the transfer of certain amino acids in human skeletal muscle. Insulin-treated athletes are perceived to have lean body mass because physiological hyperinsulinemia in human skeletal muscle improves the activity of amino acid transport, which in turn promotes protein synthesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Insulin stimulates the transport of amino acids into cells and also controls glucose metabolism. It decreases lipolysis and increases lipogenesis which is why bodybuilders and athletes use                          rhGH   in conjunction with it as to offset this negative effect while maximizing protein synthesis. The athletes extrapolated the physiology of the diabetic patient in the sporting arena because they are interested in the suppression of proteolysis. Insulin administration is found to be protein anabolic in the insulin-resistant state of chronic renal failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It inhibits proteolysis and when administered along with amino acids, it enhances net protein synthesis. Exogenous insulin injection creates an in-vivo hyperinsulinemic clamp, boosting muscle glycogen before and during the recovery phases of intense exercise. Power, strength, and stamina are all expected to increase as a result, and it might also speed up the healing process after intense physical activity. Second, insulin is expected to increase muscle mass by preventing the breakdown of muscle protein when consumed along with high carb-protein diet. Although a limited number of studies do suggest that insulin medication can be abused as a pharmacological treatment to boost strength and performance in young, healthy people or athletes, a recent assessment of the research argues that this is only applicable to a small group of  drug-na√Øve  individuals.                 

   Abuse   
The abuse of exogenous insulin carries with it an attendant risk of hypoglycemic coma and death when the amount used is in excess of that required to handle ingested carbohydrate. Acute risks include   brain damage  ,   paralysis  , and   death  . Symptoms may include dizziness, weakness, trembling,   palpitations  , seizures, confusion, headache, drowsiness, coma,   diaphoresis   and   nausea  . All persons with overdoses should be referred for medical assessment and treatment, which may last for hours or days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

Data from the US National Poison Data System  2013  indicates that 89.3  of insulin cases reported to poison centers are unintentional, as a result of therapeutic error. Another 10  of cases are intentional, and may reflect attempted suicide, abuse, criminal intent, secondary gain or other unknown reasons.                              Hypoglycemia that has been induced by exogenous insulin can be chemically detected by examining the ratio of insulin to   C-peptide   in peripheral circulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It has been suggested that this type of approach could be used to detect exogenous insulin abuse by athletes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

   Detection in biological fluids   
Insulin is often measured in serum, plasma or blood in order to monitor therapy in people who are diabetic, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized persons or assist in a medicolegal investigation of suspicious death. Interpretation of the resulting insulin concentrations is complex, given the numerous types of insulin available, various routes of administration, the presence of anti-insulin antibodies in insulin-dependent diabetics and the ''ex vivo'' instability of the drug. Other potential confounding factors include the wide-ranging cross-reactivity of commercial insulin immunoassays for the biosynthetic insulin analogs, the use of high-dose intravenous insulin as an antidote to antihypertensive drug over dosage and postmortem redistribution of insulin within the body. The use of a chromatographic technique for insulin assay may be preferable to immunoassay in some circumstances, to avoid the issue of cross-reactivity affecting the quantitative result and also to assist identifying the specific type of insulin in the specimen.                                                                                                                                                    

   Combination with other antidiabetic drugs   
A combination therapy of insulin and other   antidiabetic drug  s appears to be most beneficial in people who are diabetic, who still have residual insulin secretory capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      A combination of insulin therapy and   sulfonylurea   is more effective than insulin alone in treating people with type 2 diabetes after secondary failure to oral drugs, leading to better glucose profiles and or decreased insulin needs.

Insulin was first used as a medication in Canada by                                    Charles Best   and   Frederick Banting   in 1922.

     United States     
In the United States the unit price of insulin has increased steadily from 1991 to 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It rose threefold from 2002 to 2013.                       Costs can be as high as US 900 per month.                       Concerns were raised in 2016 of pharmaceutical companies working together to increase prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In January 2019, lawmakers from the   United States House of Representatives   sent letters to insulin manufacturers   Eli Lilly and Company  ,   Sanofi  , and   Novo Nordisk   asking for explanations for their rapidly raising insulin prices. The annual cost of insulin for people with type 1 diabetes in the US almost doubled from  2,900 to  5,700 over the period from 2012 to 2016.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

In 2019, it was estimated that people in the US pay two to six times more than the rest of the world for brand name prescription medicine, according to the International Federation of Health Plans.                 

California, in July 2022, approved a budget that allocates  100 million for the state to create its own insulin at a close-to-cost price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

     Canada     
Canada, like many other industrialized countries, has price controls on the cost of pharmaceuticals. The   Patented Medicine Prices Review Board   ensures the price of patented medicine sold in Canada is  not excessive  and remains  comparable with prices in other countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

     United Kingdom     
Insulin, and all other medications, are supplied free of charge to people who use it to manage their diabetes by the   National Health Service  s of the countries of the United Kingdom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

    Regulatory status    

     United States     
In March 2020, the FDA changed the regulatory pathway for approval of new insulin products.                                      Insulin is regulated as a biologic rather than as a drug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The changed status gives the FDA more flexibility for approval and labeling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In July 2021, the FDA approved   insulin glargine-yfgn    Semglee , a biosimilar product that contains the long acting analog insulin glargine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Insulin glargine-yfgn is interchangeable and less expensive than the reference product,   insulin glargine    Lantus , which had been approved in 2000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The FDA requires that new insulin products are not inferior to existing insulin products with respect to reduction in hemoglobin A1c.

    Inhalation    
  Main Inhalable insulin  

In 2006, the US   Food and Drug Administration    FDA  approved the use of '''Exubera''', the first   inhalable insulin  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It was withdrawn from the market by its maker in 2007 due to lack of acceptance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

Inhaled insulin claimed to have similar efficacy to injected insulin, both in terms of controlling glucose levels and blood half-life. Currently, inhaled insulin is short-acting and is typically taken before meals; an injection of long-acting insulin at night is often still required.                   When people were switched from injected to inhaled insulin, no significant difference was observed in Hb sub A1c  sub  levels over three months. Accurate dosing was a particular problem, although people showed no significant weight gain or pulmonary function decline over the length of the trial when compared to the baseline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

Following its commercial launch in 2005 in the United Kingdom, it was not  as of July 2006  recommended by   National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence   for routine use, except in cases where there is  proven injection phobia diagnosed by a psychiatrist or psychologist .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

In January 2008, the world's largest insulin manufacturer,   Novo Nordisk  , also announced that the company was discontinuing all further development of the company's own version of inhalable insulin, known as the AERx iDMS inhaled insulin system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Similarly,   Eli Lilly and Company   ended its efforts to develop its inhaled Air Insulin in March 2008.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           '''Afrezza''', developed by                        Mannkind  , was authorized by the FDA in June 2014 for use in adults with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, with a label restriction limiting its use only to those who also have   asthma  , active   lung cancer  , or   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease    COPD .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Rapid-acting inhaled insulin is a component of the drug-device combination solution that is used at the start of every meal. It employs technosphere technology, which appears to have a more practical delivery method and more dosing flexibility, and a new inhaled insulin formulation  2.5 m . A thumb-sized inhaler with improved dosage flexibility is used to deliver inhalable insulin. It includes powder-dissolved recombinant human insulin  fumaryl diketopiperazine . Technosphere insulin is quickly absorbed by the lung surface after inhalation. Within 12 hours of inhalation, both substances insulin, and powder  fumaryl diketopiperazine  are virtually eliminated from healthy people's lungs. In comparison to Exubera  8 9  , just 0.3  of inhaled insulin was still present in the lungs after 12 hours. However, since serum antibody levels have been reported to increase without substantial clinical changes, acute bronchospasm in asthmatic and COPD patients along with a significant reduction in Diffusing Lung Capacity for Carbon Monoxide, in comparison to subcutaneous insulin, have been reported with its usage, Afrezza was given FDA approval with a warning  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

    Transdermal    
There are several methods for transdermal delivery of insulin.   Pulsatile insulin   uses microjets to pulse insulin into the person, mimicking the physiological secretions of insulin by the pancreas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jet injection   had different insulin delivery peaks and durations as compared to needle injection. Some diabetics may prefer jet injectors to hypodermic injection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Both electricity using   iontophoresis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           and ultrasound have been found to make the skin temporarily porous. The insulin administration aspect remains experimental, but the blood glucose test aspect of  wrist appliances  is commercially available Researchers have produced a watch-like device that tests for blood glucose levels through the skin and administers corrective doses of insulin through                   pores   in the skin. A similar device, but relying on skin-penetrating  microneedles , was in the animal testing stage in 2015.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In the last couple of years, the use of chemical enhancers, electrical devices, and microneedle devices has shown tremendous promise for improving the penetration of insulin compared to passive transport via the skin . Transdermal insulin delivery shows a more patient-friendly and minimally invasive approach to daily diabetes care than the conventional hypodermic injection however, additional research is necessary to address issues such as long-term use, delivery efficiency, and reliability, as well as side effects involving inflammation and irritation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

    Intranasal    
Insulin can be delivered to the central nervous system via the intranasal  IN  route with little to no systemic uptake or associated peripheral side effects. It has been demonstrated that intranasally delivered insulin rapidly accumulates in CSF fluid, indicating effective transport to the brain. This accumulation is thought to occur along olfactory and nearby routes. Although numerous studies have published encouraging results, further study is still being conducted to comprehend its long-term impacts in order to begin the successful clinical application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

    By mouth    
The basic appeal of hypoglycemic agents by mouth is that most people would prefer a pill or an oral liquid to an injection. However, insulin is a   peptide hormone  , which is             digested   in the   stomach   and                 gut   and in order to be effective at controlling blood sugar, cannot be taken orally in its current form.  cn date September 2024  

The potential market for an oral form of insulin is assumed to be enormous, thus many laboratories have attempted to devise ways of moving enough intact insulin from the gut to the   portal vein   to have a measurable effect on blood sugar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

A number of           derivatization   and                              formulation   strategies are currently being pursued to in an attempt to develop an orally available insulin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Many of these approaches employ   nanoparticle   delivery systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and several are being tested in   clinical trial  s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

    Pancreatic transplantation    
  Main Islet cell transplantation  
Another improvement would be a                    transplantation   of the pancreas or beta cell to avoid periodic insulin administration. This would result in a self-regulating insulin source. Transplantation of an entire pancreas  as an individual                   organ    is difficult and relatively uncommon. It is often performed in conjunction with   liver   or   kidney   transplant, although it can be done by itself. It is also possible to do a transplantation of only the pancreatic beta cells. However, islet transplants had been highly experimental for many years, but some researchers in   Alberta, Canada  , have developed techniques with a high ''initial'' success rate  about 90  in one group . Nearly half of those who got an islet cell transplant were insulin-free one year after the operation; by the end of the second year that number drops to about one in seven. However, researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago  UIC  have slightly modified the Edmonton Protocol procedure for islet cell transplantation and achieved insulin independence in diabetic people, with fewer but better-functioning pancreatic islet cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Beta cell transplant may become practical. Additionally, some researchers have explored the possibility of transplanting                       genetically engineered   non-beta cells to secrete insulin.
