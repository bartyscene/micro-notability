  Short description Vaccine containing nucleic acids  
A '''genetic vaccine'''  also ''gene-based vaccine''  is a   vaccine   that contains   nucleic acids   such as   DNA   or   RNA   that lead to   protein biosynthesis   of   antigen  s within a cell. Genetic vaccines thus include   DNA vaccine  s,   RNA vaccine  s and   viral vector vaccine  s.

   Properties   
Most vaccines other than   live attenuated vaccine  s and genetic vaccines are not taken up by   MHC-I  -presenting cells, but act outside of these cells, producing only a strong   humoral immune response   via            antibodies  . In the case of intracellular pathogens, an exclusive humoral immune response is ineffective.                                                                                                                        Genetic vaccines are based on the principle of               uptake   of a nucleic acid into cells, whereupon a   protein   is produced according to the nucleic acid template. This protein is usually the                   immunodominant   antigen of the   pathogen   or a   surface protein   that enables the formation of   neutralizing antibodies   that inhibit the infection of cells. Subsequently, the protein is broken down at the   proteasome   into short fragments    peptide  s  that are imported into the   endoplasmic reticulum   via the   transporter associated with antigen processing  , allowing them to bind to MHCI-molecules that are subsequently             secreted   to the cell surface. The presentation of the peptides on MHC-I complexes on the cell surface is necessary for a   cellular immune response  . As a result, genetic vaccines and live vaccines generate   cytotoxic T-cell  s in addition to antibodies in the vaccinated individual. In contrast to live vaccines, only parts of the pathogen are used, which means that a                        reversion   to an infectious pathogen cannot occur as it happened during the polio vaccinations with the Sabin vaccine.                                                                                                                          

   Administration   
Genetic vaccines are most commonly administered by                        injection    intramuscular or subcutaneous  or   infusion  , and less commonly and for DNA, by   gene gun   or   electroporation  . While viral vectors have their own mechanisms to be taken up into cells, DNA and RNA must be introduced into cells via a method of   transfection  . In humans, the cationic   lipid  s   SM-102  ,   ALC-0159   and   ALC-0315   are used in conjunction with electrically neutral helper lipids. This allows the nucleic acid to be taken up by endocytosis and then released into the cytosol.

   Applications   
Examples of genetic vaccines approved for use in humans include the RNA vaccines   tozinameran   and   mRNA-1273  , the DNA vaccine   ZyCoV-D   as well as the viral vectors   AZD1222  ,   Ad26.COV2.S  ,   Ad5-nCoV  , and   Sputnik V  . In addition, genetic vaccines are being investigated against proteins of various infectious agents, protein-based   toxin  s,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            as   cancer vaccine  s,                                                                                                                                                                                                                             and as tolerogenic vaccines for   hyposensitization   of type I           allergies  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

   History   
The first use of a viral vector for vaccination   a   Modified Vaccinia Ankara Virus   expressing   HBsAg     was published by   Bernard Moss   and colleagues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  DNA was used as a vaccine by Jeffrey Ulmer and colleagues in 1993.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The first use of RNA for vaccination purposes was described in 1993 by Frédéric Martinon, Pierre Meulien and colleagues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and in 1994 by X. Zhou, Peter Liljeström, and colleagues in mice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Martinon demonstrated that a cellular immune response was induced by vaccination with an RNA vaccine.                            In 1995, Robert Conry and colleagues described that a humoral immune response was also elicited after vaccination with an RNA vaccine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          While DNA vaccines were more frequently researched in the early years due to their ease of production, low cost, and high stability to degrading enzymes, but sometimes produced low vaccine responses despite containing immunostimulatory   CpG site  s,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      more research was later conducted on RNA vaccines, whose   immunogenicity   was often better due to inherent   adjuvants   and which, unlike DNA vaccines,                                                                                                                                  cannot insert into the genome of the vaccinated. Accordingly, the first RNA- and DNA-based vaccines approved for humans were RNA and DNA vaccines used as   COVID vaccine  s. Viral vectors had previously been approved as   ebola vaccine  s.
