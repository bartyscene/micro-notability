Finally, Cas12a cleaves DNA 18\u201323 base pairs downstream from the PAM site.

By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in [[indel]] mutations that destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur. A distinctive feature of Cas12a, as compared to Cas9, is that after cutting its target, Cas12a remains bound to the target and then cleaves other ssDNA molecules non-discriminately.
